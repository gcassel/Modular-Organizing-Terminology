*A parallel process* is a *[complex process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/complex-process.md) which [emerges](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md)* from a *[set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)* which *all have* a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) *[constant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/constant.md) [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md)  [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md)* with the parallel process.
 
For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a specific parallel process may emerge from the parallel [performance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) of Process 1, Process 2 and Process 3 either *simultaneously* or in *no specific [order](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/order.md)*.
 
**Synonym(s):** *multiprocess*  

**See Also:**  *[factor](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/factor.md)*
