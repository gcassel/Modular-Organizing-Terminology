*Storage addresses* are [addresses](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/address.md) which *[identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) [storage-](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md)[locations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/location.md).*
		
Storage addresses *[enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* to *[persistently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md) store, [organize](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md), sort, filter and search for* [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) contained within [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md).  
		
**Notes:** Storage addresses are [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) by *one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)*.   In fact it's quite common for the governance of storage addresses to be ([officially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) *or* unofficially) shared between two or more agents who do not *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a [group agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md),* nor otherwise create any *[decision](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decision.md) [rule(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rule.md)* regarding the *[modification](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modify.md) of [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md)* within the storage address.   Such in[formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) approaches may be [sustainable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) *in the absence of [persistent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md) [conflict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/conflict.md)* among the governing agents.
		
*Specific [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [items](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/item.md)* are often closely [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) to specific storage addresses.  However, close relationships are not inevitable.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), [P2P Distributed Networking](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O7tJQVMHETSoWRpYC9eYsqi58ELL0Euv6L6d21LC6m0/edit?usp=sharing) [recommends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommendation.md) a *distributed hosting [model](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md)* which could [liberate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/independent.md) [shared](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/common.md) media items from dependence on any specific storage addresses.
