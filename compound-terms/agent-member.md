An *agent member* is an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) who is a *[decision-](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decision.md)making [peer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/peer.md) [member](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/member.md)* in a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [group agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md)*.

**Notes:**  

*[Group agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md)* [tend](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tend.md) to include [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) *[roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md)* for [persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md), and those roles often include a [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) and [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) "membership" role for *[personal agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/personal-agent.md)*.  Such members are peers as *[participants](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) in a specific [decision-](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decision.md)making [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)*.

Agents often [refer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/refer.md) to *agent-members* simply as *members*, [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) when the [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) seems reasonably clear.
