# Modular-Organizing-Terminology

#### Description

**Modular Organizing Terminology (MOT)** is a [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) English [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md) *[terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/terminology.md) and [ontology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ontology.md)* for [modularly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/module.md) [specified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) *[organizing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organize.md), [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) and [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) [technologies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technology.md)*. 

#### License
I've licensed MOT with [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).  This is a temporary measure in case anyone wants to use or adapt any significant parts of MOT without directly collaborating.  (I'm also very interested in co-authoring specific [definitions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md), or subsets of MOT.)  Whenever MOT's master branch seems sufficiently [stable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/stabilize.md), generally useful and successfully used, I [plan](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) to put it in the public domain-- probably with [CCO](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) or a closely corresponding [open license](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/open-license.md).

#### Acknowledgements

The development of MOT has been deeply based on my participation in the https://valueflo.ws community and related discussions regarding [REA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resources,_Events,_Agents) accounting.  Special thanks to Lynn Foster and Bob Haugen of Value Flows for their tireless, and often thankless, contributions to a wide variety of digital sensemaking efforts and projects.

#### General [Objectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md)

I ([Greg Cassel](https://github.com/gcassel/Essays/blob/master/authors-profile_greg-cassel.md)) [intend](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) for this terminology to [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md) [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) [communication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communicate.md), [coordination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordinate.md) and [collaboration](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaborate.md) in diverse [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) without [requiring](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [noisy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/noise.md) *[complexity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md)* or *[specificity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md)*.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) can use these [terms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) to *[develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* [including](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) [models](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md), [plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) and [reports](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/report.md), and to [propose](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/propose.md) [agreements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agree.md).  This terminology can also facilitate the [peer-to-peer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/p2p.md) development of non-[coercive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coerce.md) [open](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/open-license.md) [standards](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard.md) and [recipes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recipe.md). Â 

#### Disclaimer

MOT terms (or derivations thereof) are suggested for use only on an as-needed basis.  (I'd never suggest for anyone to adopt the entire repository, some of which is half-baked at best!)  The importance of [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) definitions varies widely depending on social context.  In some contexts it's crucial; this is why (for example) legal documents often include introductory lists of special definitions.  

Another disclaimer of note is that I'm generally critical and suspicious of [automation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/automate.md); for example, any use of MOT terms (including [algorithms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/algorithm.md) [programs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/program.md) or [mandatory](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mandate.md) [procedures](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/procedure.md) [based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) on them) which [restricts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restrict.md) or [removes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/remove.md) human agency.  I want terminology (and technology in general) to empower people, through improved communications and sensemaking, instead of enslaving them.

So far, MOT has been mostly my "solo" work, although in dialogue at times with varied [groups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) and [projects](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md).  I do *not* consider such sole [stewardship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/steward.md) to be [desirable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/desire.md) for [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) major resources!  I'm planning to [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) co-stewarded [branches](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/branch.md) and [forks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fork.md) of MOT as [consent-based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/consent-based.md) [team](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/team.md) [projects](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md), as soon as [feasible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/feasible.md).  More importantly, however, I hope to help people and projects to export useful definitions on an as-needed basis.

#### [Special](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) Objectives

I'm using this [repository's](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/repository.md) [hyperlinked](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hyperlink.md) [definitions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) to standardize terminology in [my organizing models](https://github.com/gcassel/Models) and [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) [documents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/document.md).  **[Inclusive Organizing Frameworks](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1-WFMRYdueSBba1atcohX0G585zj-gBNlBvZQBqnEmEs/edit?usp=sharing)** [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) many relationships between MOT and specific organizing models.

Additionally, I'll work with others to import mutually useful MOT terms into one or more *[collectively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md)* repositories.

#### Formal Context

MOT can be seen as a bridge between machine-readable languages and natural languages, including most formal writing such as [policies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/policy.md) and [laws](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/law.md).  Compared to most machine-readable languages, MOT is much larger and more [flexible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/flexible.md), but less syntactically and grammatically [precise](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/precise.md).

#### Philosophical [Context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)

This terminology supports an *[action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md), [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) and [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) based* [philosophy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/philosophize.md) of [science](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/science.md) and [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md).  MOT's *human-centered* terms intentionally [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) [mental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mental.md), [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) and [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [experiences](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md).  One of my [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) goals here is to help [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitation.md) more [effective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md) and [consistent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/consistent.md) [descriptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) of such relationships.  I hope to share that goal with other agents via [distributed version control](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distributed-version-control.md) and 
[creative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) [mergers](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/merge.md).

#### Additional Notes

Some [terms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) in MOT already have excellent [technical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technical.md) descriptions elsewhere.  I've added MOT entries for them mainly to [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) [responsible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/responsibility.md) MOT-[compatible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compatible.md) governance (and coordination) of [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [modifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modify.md) of these terms.

The vast majority of MOT definitions are stored in verb form; for example, [clarify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/clarify.md) instead of clarity.  

Occasionally, for important words which are close synonyms of root terms, or are spelled significantly differently from their root verb, a redirection definition has been added to MOT.  (For example, *[clear](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/clear.md)* redirects to *clarify*.)

**This repository will often be [edited](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/edit.md) as terms are [interactively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) developed.**  Some of the fundamental terms here are especially difficult to [limit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md) and describe, and will need to be [inclusively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) developed through open [dialogue](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dialogue.md) between diverse agents.
