# Modular-Organizing-Terminology

#### Description

**Modular Organizing Terminology (MOT)** is a [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) English [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md) [terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/terminology.md) for [modularly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/module.md) [specified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) *[organizing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organize.md), [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) and [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) [technologies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technology.md)*. 

#### License
I've licensed MOT with [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).  This is a temporary measure in case anyone wants to use or adapt any significant parts of MOT without directly collaborating.  Whenever MOT's master branch seems sufficiently stable, generally useful and successfully used, I [plan](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) to put it in the public domain-- probably with [CCO](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) or a closely corresponding [open license](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/open-license.md).  


#### General [Objectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md)

I ([Greg Cassel](https://github.com/gcassel/Essays/blob/master/authors-profile_greg-cassel.md)) [intend](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) for this terminology to [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md) [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) [communication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communicate.md), [coordination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordinate.md) and [collaboration](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaborate.md) in diverse [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) without [requiring](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [noisy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/noise.md) *[complexity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md)* or *[specificity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md)*.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) can use these [terms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) to *[develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* [including](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) [models](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md), [plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) and [reports](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/report.md), and to [propose](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/propose.md) [agreements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agree.md).  This terminology can also facilitate the [peer-to-peer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/p2p.md) development of non-[coercive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coerce.md) [open](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/open-license.md) [standards](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard.md) and [recipes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recipe.md).  

MOT terms (or derivations thereof) are suggested for use only on an as-needed basis.  The importance of formal definitions varies widely depending on social context.  In some contexts it's crucial; this is why (for example) legal documents often include introductory lists of special definitions.  

#### [Special](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) Objectives

I'm using this [repository's](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/repository.md) [hyperlinked](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hyperlink.md) [definitions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) to standardize terminology in [my organizing models](https://github.com/gcassel/Models) and [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) [documents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/document.md).  **[Inclusive Organizing Frameworks](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1-WFMRYdueSBba1atcohX0G585zj-gBNlBvZQBqnEmEs/edit?usp=sharing)** [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) many relationships between MOT and specific organizing models.

Additionally, I'll work with others to import mutually useful MOT terms into one or more *[collectively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md)* repositories.

#### Philosophical [Context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)

This terminology supports an *[action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md), [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) and [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) based* [philosophy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/philosophize.md) of [science](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/science.md) and [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md).  MOT's *human-centered* terms intentionally [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) [mental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mental.md), [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) and [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [experiences](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md).  One of my [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) goals here is to help [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitation.md) more [effective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md) and [consistent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/consistent.md) [descriptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) of such relationships.  I hope to share that goal with other agents via [distributed version control](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distributed-version-control.md) and potential [creative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) [mergers](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/merge.md).

#### Notes

Some [terms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) in MOT already have excellent [technical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technical.md) descriptions elsewhere.  I've added MOT entries for them mainly to [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) [responsible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/responsibility.md) MOT-[compatible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compatible.md) governance (and coordination) of [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [modifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modify.md) of these terms.

The vast majority of MOT definitions are stored in verb form; for example, [clarify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/clarify.md) instead of clarity.  

Occasionally, for important words which are close synonyms of root terms, or are spelled significantly differently from their root verb, a redirection definition has been added to MOT.  (For example, *[clear](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/clear.md)* redirects to *clarify*.)

**This repository will often be [edited](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/edit.md) as terms are [interactively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) developed.**  Some of the fundamental terms here are especially difficult to [limit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md) and describe, and will need to be [inclusively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) developed through open [dialogue](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dialogue.md) between diverse agents.
