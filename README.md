# Inclusive Organizing Texts

#### Description

**Inclusive Organizing Texts (IOT)** is a repository of git Markdown files for [Inclusive Organizing](https://inclusiveorg.net).

_** Until 12 March 2025, Inclusive Organizing Texts was known as Modular Organizing Terminology, and its sole purpose was to host the MOT ontology and definitions, which are now in IOT's [terms](https://github.com/inclusiveorg/iot/tree/master/terms) folder. **_

### Topics

The new _topics_ folder will be used to compose modular hypertexts on many interrelated subjects. These git files could replace much of Inclusive Organizing's use of Google Workspace.

### Terms (Terminology)
_(The following description now applies to IOT/terms)_

**Modular Organizing Terminology (MOT)** is a [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [open source](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) English [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md) *[ontology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ontology.md) and [terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/terminology.md)* which can be [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) or [adapted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/adapt.md) for many *[organizing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organize.md), [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) and [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md)* [principles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/principle.md) and [practices](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/practice.md).

#### General [Objectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md)

MOT's [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [mission](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mission.md) is to [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md) [inclusive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) [discussion](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/discuss.md), [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md), [decision](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decide.md) and [practice](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/practice.md)-- and, thus, [effective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md) [communication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communicate.md), [coordination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordinate.md) and [collaboration](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaborate.md)-- in diverse [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  MOT is made to be adapted from its [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) extreme [generalizations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) into whichever [definitions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) or [ontologies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ontology.md) are [sufficiently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/suffice.md) [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md), [flexible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/flexible.md) *and* effective in a [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) or [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) can use these [terms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md)-- or adaptations thereof-- to *[develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* [including](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) [models](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md), [plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) and [reports](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/report.md), and to [propose](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/propose.md) [agreements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agree.md).  This terminology can also facilitate the inclusive development of non-[coercive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coerce.md) [open](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/open-license.md) [standards](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard.md) and [p2p](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/p2p.md) [recipes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recipe.md). Â The author would like to discuss uses and adaptations of MOT.

#### [Special](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) Objectives

MOT also currently serves as fundamental [infrastructure](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/infrastructure.md) (and an [iterative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/iterate.md) testing ground) for my personal [vocabulary](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/vocabulary.md) and sensemaking journey, and I'm using this [repository's](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/repository.md) [hyperlinked](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hyperlink.md) [definitions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) to standardize terminology in [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) [organizing models](https://github.com/gcassel/Models) and [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) [documents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/document.md).  **[Inclusive Organizing](https://inclusiveorg.net) [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) many relationships between MOT and specific organizing models.

Additionally, I'll work with others to import [mutually](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mutual.md) useful MOT terms into one or more *[collectively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md)* repositories.

#### Formal Context

MOT can be seen as a bridge between machine-[readable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/read.md) languages and natural languages, including most [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) [writing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/write.md) such as [policies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/policy.md) and [laws](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/law.md).  Compared to most machine-readable languages, MOT is much larger and more [flexible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/flexible.md), but less syntactically and [grammatically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/grammar.md) [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md).  (Specificity can be increased by adapting MOT for specific [projects](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md) and [communities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md).)

Some MOT definitions are directly used in [IO](https://inclusiveorg.net)-based systems, although IO has [its own repository](https://github.com/gcassel/IO) to be used as needed.

#### Philosophical [Context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)

This terminology supports an *[action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md), [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md), [relations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) and [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) based* [philosophy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/philosophize.md) of [science](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/science.md) and [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md).  MOT is action and relation based because it seeks to define most (and, perhaps ultimately, all) concepts as verbs according to mutual [influences](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/influence.md), meaning actions and change which [tend](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tend.md) to occur in very specific [implicit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/imply.md) or explicit relationships and contexts.  MOT's *human-centered* terms intentionally [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) [mental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mental.md), [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) and [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [experiences](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md).  One of my [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) goals here is to help [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md) more [effective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md) and [consistent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/consistent.md) [descriptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) of such relationships.  I hope to share that goal with other agents via [distributed version control](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distributed-version-control.md) and 
[creative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) [mergers](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/merge.md).

#### Disclaimers

Many MOT definitions are provisional (either incomplete or insufficiently specific), and some are merely placeholders. The completeness of each definition cannot be determined by its latest revision date, because some updates are simply bug fixes (often, broken hyperlinks) or incomplete updates of aged definitions.  (Please inquire about any terms which you're especially interested in updating or adapting.)

Even with MOT's most up-to-date definitions, the use of MOT terms (or derivations thereof) are suggested for use only on an as-needed basis.  (I'd never suggest for anyone to adopt the entire repository, some of which is half-baked at best!)  The importance of [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) definitions varies widely depending on social context.  In some contexts it's crucial; this is why (for example) legal documents often include introductory lists of special definitions.  

Another disclaimer of note is that I'm generally critical and suspicious of [automation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/automate.md); for example, any use of MOT terms (including [algorithms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/algorithm.md) [programs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/program.md) or [mandatory](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mandate.md) [procedures](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/procedure.md) [based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) on them) which [restricts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restrict.md) or [removes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/remove.md) human agency.  I want terminology (and technology in general) to empower people, through improved communications and sensemaking, instead of enslaving them.

So far, MOT has been mostly my "solo" work, although in dialogue at times with varied [groups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) and [projects](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md).  I do *not* consider such sole [stewardship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/steward.md) to be [desirable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/desire.md) for [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) major resources!  I'm planning to [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) co-stewarded [branches](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/branch.md) and [forks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fork.md) of MOT as [consent-based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/consent-based.md) [team](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/team.md) [projects](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md), as soon as [feasible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/feasible.md).  More importantly, however, I hope to help people and projects to export useful definitions on an as-needed basis.

#### Greg's Acknowledgements

The development of MOT has been deeply based on my participation in the https://valueflo.ws community and related discussions regarding [REA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resources,_Events,_Agents) accounting.  Special thanks to Lynn Foster and Bob Haugen of Value Flows for their tireless, and often thankless, contributions to a wide variety of digital sensemaking efforts and projects.  Special thanks also to my brilliant partner Lane, who has been a key force in everything I've done since MOT's genesis.

#### Additional Notes

Some [terms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) in MOT already have excellent [technical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technical.md) descriptions elsewhere.  I've added MOT entries for them mainly to [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) [responsible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/responsibility.md) MOT-[compatible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compatible.md) governance (and coordination) of [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [modifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modify.md) of these terms.

The vast majority of MOT definitions are stored in verb form; for example, [clarify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/clarify.md) instead of clarity.  

Occasionally, for important words which are close synonyms of root terms, or are spelled significantly differently from their root verb, a redirection definition has been added to MOT.  (For example, *[clear](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/clear.md)* redirects to *clarify*.)

**This repository will often be [edited](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/edit.md) as terms are [interactively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) developed.**  Some of the fundamental terms here are especially difficult to [limit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md) and describe, and will need to be [inclusively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) developed through open [dialogue](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dialogue.md) between diverse agents.
