# maladapt

**Definition**

_To maladapt_ is _to_ [_change_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/change.md) _an_ [_element_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) _in a way which decreases its_ [_fitness_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fitness.md) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Notes**

The [_act_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) _of maladaptation_ can be considered [harmful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/harm.md) in a [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) context, even if a maladapted element remains mostly [beneficial](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/benefit.md) within that context.

A [_type_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) _of element_ may become maladapted for a specific context because it's become _better adapted_ for a _different_ context. For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a _species of organism_ may adapt for a specific [_physical_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) __ [_ecosystem_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ecosystem.md) in ways which are maladaptive in another ecosystem which _some specimens_ of that species live in. Also, a species or [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may adapt for a [_temporary_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/temporary.md) __ [_status_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/status.md) (such as an [emergency](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergency.md)) in ways which are maladaptive during a _longer_ [_period_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md) within a specific context.
