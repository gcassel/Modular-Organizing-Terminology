# post

**Definition**

A _post_ is a [_role_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md)_, or a_ [_set_](set.md) _of roles_, which _is_ [_officially_](official.md) __ [_assigned_](assign.md) _in a_ [_specific_](specific.md) __ [_collective_](collective.md).

**Notes**

Most posts are [based](base.md) on one [specific](specific.md) role; however, they often [authorize](authorize.md) several sub-roles which are [intended](intend.md) to [facilitate](facilitate.md) [effective](effective.md) [performance](perform.md) of the basic role. For example, a committee chairperson could have a set of many official [powers](power.md) which are [automatically](automate.md) authorized by the chairperson post. Such sets of official powers, while common, are often un[stable](stabilize.md), and are frequently [modified](modify.md) as collectives [develop](develop.md).

A post often [identifies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) a role which is [_uniquely_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) __ [_assigned_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assignment.md) _within a specific collective_. However, a post can also define a [team](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/team.md).

**Related Terms**

_Position_ and _title_ are often used as synonyms of _post_. However, those [terms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) have other uses which are more [_fundamentally_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) __ [_useful_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) in [modular](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modular.md) [organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md). Therefore, they are used differently in [Modular Organizing Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology).
