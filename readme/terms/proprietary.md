**Definition**

_Proprietary_ is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/trait.md) of any [_resource_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/resource.md) _which is_ [_provided_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/provide.md) _by an_ [_owner_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/own.md) _who retains one or more_ [_exclusive_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/exclude.md) __ [_legal_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/law.md) __ [_rights_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/right.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/specific.md) [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/context.md).

[**Specialized**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/specialize.md) **** [**Meaning**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/mean.md)

[Use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/use.md) of the [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/term.md) _proprietary_ has almost always seemed to [imply](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/imply.md) the exclusively retained legal right to [_require_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/require.md) _payment in_ [_money_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/money.md) for others' use of the resource in question. However, it's debatable whether or not that right should be deeply separated from all other exclusive legal rights.
