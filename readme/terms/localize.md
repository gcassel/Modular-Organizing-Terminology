# localize

**Definitions**

_To localize_ is to [_specialize_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) _the_ [_scope_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md) of a [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) according to one or more [_intended_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) __ [_locations_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/location.md) _of_ [_use_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md).

_Localized_ is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which _have had their scope localized_, regardless of whether that reduction reflects _design_ [_priorities_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/prioritize.md) or [_emergent_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) __ [_adaptation_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/adapt.md).

**Notes**

Localization often reduces [spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md) scope, but may also reduce a _field_ of [_potential_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) __ [_relationships_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) _and_ [_roles_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) according to [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) relationships, including [communities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md) based on the _digitally_ _distributed_ [creation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) or [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) of [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md).
