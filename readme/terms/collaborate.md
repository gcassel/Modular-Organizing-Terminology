# collaborate

**Definition**

_To collaborate_ is _to_ [_work_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/work.md) on a [_mutually_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mutual.md) __ [_shared_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/share.md) __ [_goal_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) with the [intention](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) of [_creating_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) _one or more_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_products_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/product.md) _together_.

**Notes**

Collaboration can be [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) by [_identifying_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) __ [_shared_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/common.md) _goals_ or _shared_ [_plans_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md).

The intended goals of collaboration may [complexly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md) contain separately [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) goals or products. However, collaborators perceive value in a unified pursuit of [developing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) those goals or products(s). Their unified pursuit creates some (lesser or greater) degree of shared [investment](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/invest.md); this often [requires](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) [significant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) [trust](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trust.md) and/or [accountability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accountability.md).

Collaboration often occurs in[form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)ally and un[official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md)ly. However, a [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) may officially (and [complexly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md)) [assign](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) _subordinate_ work to [_subgroups_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/substructure.md).
