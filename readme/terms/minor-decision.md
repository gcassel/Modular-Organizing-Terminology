# minor-decision

**Definition**

A _Minor Decision_ is a decision which has _a gross collective_ [_cost_](cost.md) which _clearly does not exceed_ the _highest_ of any following values:

1. an applicable Personal Minor Decision Authorization
2. an applicable Team Minor Decision Authorization
3. (if implemented) the Collective Minor Decision Authorization

**Examples**

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20, then it would be a Minor Decision to give $18-$19 of sample products to a customer.

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20 but you have a personal [post](post.md) which authorizes distributing up to $50 of free samples per week, then it would be a Minor Decision to distribute any samples until that limit is hit.

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20 but you're acting outside of the scope of your [team](team.md) [roles](role.md) _and_ your personal post(s), then distributing _any_ free samples would be a non-Minor Decision. (Probably a [Standard Decision](standard-decision.md), unless you're giving away a huge amount of products.)

**Notes**

Document every Minor Decision which changes any resources which we track on spreadsheets, including raw ingredients and Inventory items.
