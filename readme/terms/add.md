# add

**Definition**

_To add_ is _to_ [_transport_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transport.md) _an_ [_element_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) _into a_ [_form_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md), or to [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) that element there.

**Specialized Meaning**

_enter_: _Enter_ often refers to [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) by [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) who add elements ([potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) including themselves) to formal contexts.

**Notes**

The [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) of _adding_ may seem [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) and obvious compared to many other [MOT](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/) [terms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md). However, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may find it [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) to [perceive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) that elements may be added in two distinct ways:

1. _transporting a_ [_scarce_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scarce.md) _element (such as a_ [_physical_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) __ [_resource_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)_) from one_ [_location_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/locate.md) _to another_
2. [_creating_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) _and_ [_representing_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) _a new_ [_association_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/associate.md)
