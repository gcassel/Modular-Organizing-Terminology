# agree

**Definitions**

_To agree_ is _to_ [_recognize_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recognize.md) _the_ [_validity_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/valid.md) _of a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_concept_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

_Agreement_ is a [_relational trait_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relational-trait.md) which [indicates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) that _two or more_ [_agents_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) __ [_agree_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agree.md) _on a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_concept_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md).

**Specialized Definition**

_An_ [_official_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) _agreement_ is _a_ [_statement_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md) _which is_ [_mutually_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mutual.md) __ [_approved_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/approve.md) by _all_ [_agents_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Notes**

To fully agree with a concept, we must agree with the validity of each [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) within that concept. This is often quite [socially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) challenging. (It's hard to fully agree with highly complex concepts.)

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) agreements through [discussion](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dialogue.md) and [proposals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/propose.md). Proposals and agreements may be developed through any combination of [sequential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) and [parallel](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/parallel.md) [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md).

**Official agreements are** [**important**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) **in many** [**social**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) **contexts.** Official agreements are [_authorized_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authorize.md) _by_ [_governing_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) _agents_ in many contexts.

Official agreements must be clearly and demonstrably [approved](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/approve.md), often via the [signatures](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signature.md) of agreeing agents in [persistently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md) [stored](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [items](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/item.md).

Agreements must be stated in a [_mutually_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mutual.md) __ [_understood_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/understand.md) __ [_language_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md).

**Agreements often** [**describe**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) **** [**plans**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md), although a [_shared_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/common.md) _plan_ is just one basic [_type_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) _of agreement_.
