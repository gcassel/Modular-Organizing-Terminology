# channel

[**Definition**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md)

A channel is _a_ [_path_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/path.md) _which_ [_enables_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) __ [_transmission_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md) between [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) _(_[_force_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md) _and_ [_signal_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md)_)_ [_sources_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/source.md) _and_ [_destinations_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/destination.md).

**Specialized Definition:** In the [development](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) of [governance resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance-resource.md), _channel_ may mean any _channel (e.g._ [_group_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md)_,_ [_communications_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communicate.md) _platform, channel, online_ [_forum_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/forum.md)_,_ [_meeting_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/meeting.md)_,_ [_event_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md) _or_ [_activity_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md)_, or subgroup/segment thereof_) which is [_governed_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) _or_ [_stewarded_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/steward.md) _by a specific_ [_project_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md) _or_ [_system_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md). (This is an extremely generic and broad, flexible definition, but it's specific to governance.)

**Notes**

Channels carry forces and signals between [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) in systems, or (more [precisely](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/precise.md), when [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md)) between [interfaces](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interface.md).

Countless channels and [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of channel exist, and many are expansive. (For example, an electromagnetic wave can propagate throughout the observable universe.) However, [communications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communicate.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) often [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) [_specialized_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) _channels_. Specialized channels are often [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md). Governed channels are often [gated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/gate.md) to reduce [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [harm](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md) and [noise](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/noise.md).

Digital channels [_enable_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) __ [_agents_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) _to_ [_send_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/send.md) (and [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) _stream_) signals to two [_basic_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) __ [_types_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) _of_ [_receivers_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/receive.md):

* local or remote _networking_ [_components_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md)_, or_ [_sets_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) _of components_
  * These may include electronic [displays](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/display.md), relays and [storage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md).
  * note: in [distributed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) networking, receivers may be identified as [_instances_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) _of_ [_types_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) instead of as [unique](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) receivers.
* [addresses](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/address.md) &#x20;

Authorization to use digital channels is [technically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technical.md) [regulated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/regulate.md) by regulating the [distribution](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) of [computing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compute.md) [devices](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md) and, sometimes, [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [keys](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/key.md).

Signal sources and destinations are often [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md) by different agents.  **Each agent (using a specific** [**identity**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identity.md) **and a** [**compatible**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compatible.md) **** [**application**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/application.md)**) may be separately** [**authorized**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authorize.md) **to send and/or** [**receive**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/receive.md) **signals from each channel.** &#x20;

For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), one agent may be authorized to send a _video + voice signal_ to a channel which many other agents can simultaneously receive that signal (and other signals) from. &#x20;

Specific networks or [communities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md) may allow (and directly enable) agents to extend their channel usage rights to [delegates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/delegate.md), which could be other agents _or_ [bots](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/bot.md).

[Persistent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md) channels are often [_technically_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technical.md) __ [_able_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ability.md) to receive signals at all times. However, sending and receiving authorizations for specific agents may be granted persistently _or_ [temporarily](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/temporary.md).  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), an application may [permit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/permit.md) a specific address to only receive video signals during a 1:00pm to 2:00 pm [meeting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/meet.md), and specific agents may only be permitted to send audio (via microphones) during certain [periods](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md) within that meeting. &#x20;
