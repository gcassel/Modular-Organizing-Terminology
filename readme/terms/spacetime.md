# spacetime

**Definition**

_Spacetime_ is the [_complex_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) __ [_dimension_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) of [relative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [change](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/change.md).

**Notes**

[Persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) often [experience](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) [time](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/time.md) _and_ spacetime [_based_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) _on_ a [_conceived_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) __ [_sequence_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) _of (also conceived)_ [_events_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md). Each conceived [step](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/step.md) in such sequences [tends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tend.md) to [_practically_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/practice.md) _disregard_ the space between _quickly_ [_interacting_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) __ [_physical_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) __ [_elements_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).

Because the distance between quickly interacting elements is normally disregarded, the [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) _time_ is much more commonly [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) than the more [_socially_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) __ [_basic_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) and [_accurate_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accurate.md) term _spacetime_.
