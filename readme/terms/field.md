A field is a *[set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of [locations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/location.md)*, or a *set of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) in [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) locations*.

Fields often (but not always) contain only *contiguous* locations.

Fields may be [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) by any [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) which can [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) a set of locations, including *mathematical [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md)*.  Many [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) fields are defined according to three-dimensional *space* or four-dimensional [spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md).
