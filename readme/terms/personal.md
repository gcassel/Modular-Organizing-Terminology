# personal

**Definition**

_Personal_ is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which _is_ [_assigned_](assign.md) _to one or more_ [_specific_](specific.md) __ [_persons_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) in a specific [context](context.md).

**Specialized Definition**

In common usage, _personal_ elements are often [_social_](social.md) _but_ [_private_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/private.md). For example, people often refer to "personal business" and "personal relationships" which include one or more other person. Such elements are technically _interpersonal_ as well as personal.

**Notes**

Since personal elements can be social, they are often closely [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to [cultural](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/culture.md), [economic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/economy.md) and [political](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/politics.md) elements.
