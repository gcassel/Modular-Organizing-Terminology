# simplicity

**Definition**

_Simplicity_ is a [dimension](dimension.md) which is the _inverse of_ [_complexity_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md).

_Simple_ is a [trait](trait.md) of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which have high simplicity within a [specific](specific.md) [context](context.md).

**Notes**

Most elements are [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md); however, a perfectly simple element isn't a form at all. (It could however be part of one or more forms.)
