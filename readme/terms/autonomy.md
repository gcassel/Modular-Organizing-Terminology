# autonomy

**Definition**

_Autonomy_ is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) who [_may_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/may.md) __ [_self-determine_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/self-determine.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) such as a [community](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md), [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) or a [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md).

**Notes**

Autonomy is often used in the context of local or regional [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) which is subject to broader governance [policies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/policy.md), in contrast to the greater autonomy afforded by [sovereignty](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sovereign.md).
