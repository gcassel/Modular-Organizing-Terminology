**Definition**

_To believe_ is _to_ [_persistently_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md) __ [_perceive_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) _that a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_concept_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) _is_ [_true_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/true.md) throughout a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [interval](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) of [time](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/time.md).

**Notes**

_Believe_ is an extremely [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md).

_Belief_ is often associated with very long-term perceptions. However, the term may [accurately](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) _brief perceptions_ when the context of its [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) is sufficiently [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md). (For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a [person](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) may [state](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md) that they ran away from a specific stranger because they [mistakenly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mistake.md) _believed_ that the stranger [planned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) to attack them.)
