# form

**Definitions**

_To form_ is _to_ [_create_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) _an_ [_element_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which [_groups_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) _other elements_.

_A form_ is an element which groups other elements.

_Formal_ is a [trait](trait.md) of [relationships](relate.md) which have been [strictly](strict.md) grouped, often according to [official](official.md) [standards](standard.md).

**Notes**

_Form_ is a [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) and extremely [flexible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/flexible.md) [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) in [Modular Organizing Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/). **Forms include all** [**sets**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md)**,** [**networks**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md)**,** [**systems**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) **and** [**collectives**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md)**.**

Forms can group elements which are either [actual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) _or_ [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) within a [specific](specific.md) [context](context.md).

Forms can [emerge](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emerge.md) un[intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md), with or without [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) by [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md). Forms can also be [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) by agents to [frame](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/frame.md) potential elements.

Forms can _include_ one or more specific [_groups_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) _of elements_. Forms which contain groups might _or_ might not be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) as the _sum, or the product_ of those specific groups.

**A specific** [_**instance**_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) _**or**_ [_**type**_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) **of element can be** [**described**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) **as an element **_**or**_** as a form**, depending on context and [scale](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scale.md) of [perception](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md)/ perspective such as specific [_hierarchical_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) __ [_level_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level.md).

A form must be [usefully](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) [_stable_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/stabilize.md) within one or more contexts. However, those contexts may be identified [_physically_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md)_,_ [_conceptually_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) _or_ [_experientially_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md). For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), physical contexts have [_spacetime_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md) __ [_scale_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scale.md), within which forms can be identified by [_potential_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) __ [_participant_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) __ [_agents_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) and/or _sensing_ [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md).

Physical forms can be [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) as _particles_, [intervals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md), [waves](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/wave.md) or [fields](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/field.md) at different levels of detail. Instances of those types of form can variably be experienced as _fluid_ or _solid_ at different scales of [organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organize.md).

Fluid forms often last briefly. For example, an identifiably shaped gust (four dimensional waveform) of wind could last a few seconds. However, fluid forms also can [endure](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/endure.md) indefinitely if sustained by [repeated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/repeat.md) [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) of energy. For example, a stretch of rapids on a river, or an oceanic whirlpool, could last for decades or centuries.

Solid forms can also last briefly. For example, a snowflake could melt a few seconds after landing on a warm surface. However, solid forms can last long periods in the absence of intensely or persistently creative/destructive energy. For example, a mountain could endure (while slowly eroding) for millions of years.

Conceptual forms often can have analogies to physical _solidity_ and _fluidity_.

**Forms often** [_**function**_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) **as elements** in large-[scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md) models (or [overviews](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/overview.md)) with low levels of detail. For instance, snowflakes and mountains often function as conceptual elements, despite being clearly identifiable as ([complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md)) forms.

**Synonyms**

_build_, _construct_, _structure_

[**Specialized**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) **Definitions**

_Structure_ often especially means _the_ [_networking_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) _of_ [_physical_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) __ [_elements_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).

Within that [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), _a structure_ is a [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) _network of physical elements_.

_A building_ often especially means _a non-_[_portable_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/portable.md) _network of physical elements._

Structure also often [implies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/imply.md) [_designed_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) _structure_ in some [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md). However, it's also used broadly to [indicate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) [emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) structures.
