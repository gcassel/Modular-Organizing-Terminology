# alpha

**Definition**

An _alpha_ is a [_prototype_](prototype.md) which _isn’t ready for_ [_direct_](direct.md) __ [_use_](use.md) _within its_ [_naming_](name.md) __ [_context_](context.md).

**Notes**

If a prototype is an alpha for [_Collective_](collective.md) _A_, then it’s not ready for [responsible](responsibility.md) use by many or most people in Collective A.

Prototype names may use “-alpha” or, in a reasonably clear context, simply “a”.
