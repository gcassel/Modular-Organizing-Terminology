# write

**Definitions**

_To write_ is _to_ [_store_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) __ [_language_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md) _in a_ [_persistent_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md) __ [_medium_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md).

_Written_ is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of language which is held in persistent media.

**Notes**

For most of human history, all media was entered purely in solid physical forms; in [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md), writing is often still microscopically encoded in physical forms (e.g. persistent [structural](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) changes in circuitry), but can also exist evanescently as (nomadic) electrical signals.
