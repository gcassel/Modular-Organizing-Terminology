# activity

**Definition**

_Activity_ is _a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_type_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) _of_ [_action_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md).

**Specialized Definition**

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) the [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) _activity_ to [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) [_socially_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) __ [_shared_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/common.md) __ [_events_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md).

**Notes**

Because an activity is a _type of action_, it may include many [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) [instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) which meet the [definition](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) of that type. (For example, _getting exercise_ is an activity which might include instances of walking, swimming, yoga or weight training, etcetera, and _weight training_ is an activity (at a different [hierarchical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) [level](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level.md)) which might include instances of squats or bench presses, etcetera.)

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) sometimes [define](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) activities in static terms, such as [_maintaining_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/maintain.md) _specific_ [_resources_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) in practical stasis. This is because maintenance _can require agents to apply many specific actions_ to potentially [damaging](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md) [forces](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md). (Maintenance is [_active_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) __ [_support_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md).)

Activities can be [modeled](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) as [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md).
