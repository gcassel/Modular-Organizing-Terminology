# draft

**Definition**

A draft is a [_unique_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) __ [_instance_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of a [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) [version](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/version.md) which is _not_ an [official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [edition](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/edition.md).

**Notes**

"Draft" is an [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of resource. However, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may consider it synonymous with _work-in-progress_, and exclusive of _archival media_. Agents may even consider "draft" to be synonymous with _current instance_. (_Work-in-progress here!_)
