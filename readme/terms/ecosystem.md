# ecosystem

**Definition**

An _ecosystem_ is a [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) which is _at least partly_ [_based_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) _on_ [_relationships_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) _between_ [_sovereign_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sovereign.md) __ [_organisms_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organism.md).

**Notes**

Each ecosystem is _a system of systems_, because each organism is a system. Ecosystems can have many multidirectional [_hierarchical_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) __ [_levels_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level.md), as well as nonhierarchical relationships which [link](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md) many [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) and [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md).
