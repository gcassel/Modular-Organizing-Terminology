# arbitrary

**Definition**

_Arbitrary_ is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of [_selecting_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/select.md) _or_ [_ordering_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/order.md) __ [_action_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) which has no [intended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [meaning](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mean.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Notes**

Arbitrary actions _may_ have clear meaning to [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) who [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) them. However, agents are [generally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) expected to perform arbitrary actions in ways which don't [display](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/display.md) any _unfair_ [_personal_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) _biases_. Often, agents are also expected to perform arbitrary actions without [using](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) any [criteria](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/criterion.md) which are inappropriately [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to the formal context in question.

_To arbitrate_ has a [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) and [significantly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) different meaning. That [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) may be added to [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/), but is not currently an [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) [priority](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/prioritize.md).
