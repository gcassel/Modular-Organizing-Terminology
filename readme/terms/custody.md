# custody

**Definition**

_Custody_ is a [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) in which an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) (1) currently _has_ [_potentially_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) __ [_exclusive_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/exclude.md) __ [_access_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md) to a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) or (another) agent, and (2) therefore _is_ [_socially_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) __ [_responsible_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/responsibility.md) for _excluding_ [_contextually_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) _unacceptable_ [_risky_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md) _and_ [_damaging_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md) __ [_forces_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md) from the resource or agent in custody.

**Notes**

Custody is _often_ directly [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) to full access or [ownership](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/own.md) rights. However, custody may be a [_required_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md) __ [_function_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) in some contexts _without_ any [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [beneficial](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/benefit.md) [rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md) attached to it. For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a delivery driver may need to take custody of three pizzas while driving to meet those pizzas' [buyer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/buy.md). Likewise, a prison guard may need to take custody of a prisoner during required [transportation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transport.md).
