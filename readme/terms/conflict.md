# conflict

**Definition**

Conflict is [stress](stress.md) which is [_created_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) _or increased_ by one or more _in_[_compatible_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compatible.md) __ [_actions_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Notes:**

Conflict is a social [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) with highly [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) [states](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md). For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), conflict often [develops](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) when one [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) has a specific goal, and another agent _intends to_ [_prevent_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/prevent.md) the completion of that goal.

Conflict often leads to [contention](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/contend.md), [coercion](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coerce.md), [violence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/violence.md) and unintentional [damage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md). Such actions may [motivate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/motivation.md) conflict [resolution](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resolve.md) and [mediation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) actions.
