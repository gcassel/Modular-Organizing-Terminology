**Definition**

_Authority_ is the [_permission_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/permit.md) _to_ [_perform_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) _or, if allowed, to_ [_delegate_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/delegate.md) _a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_activity_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) in a specific [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Notes**

Authority is purely about permission in MOT; it's not [_directly_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) related to [reputation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/reputation.md) and/or [credibility](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/credibility.md).

[Official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) authority is always [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md), and is rarely directly accepted or [consented](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/consent.md) to by _all_ people whose [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) are [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [regulated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/regulation.md), [restricted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restrict.md) or otherwise [coerced](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coerce.md) by authoritative activity.
