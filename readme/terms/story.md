_A story_ is _a_ [_description_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) _of_ [_actions_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) which [_signifies_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sign.md) _a_ [_perceived_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) __ [_sequence_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) in one or more [dimensions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) such as [spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md).

**Notes:**

This entry will need some work to focus practically upon our perceptions of spacetime sequential processes, and to illustrate the profound importance of stories in developing relationships we perceive.
