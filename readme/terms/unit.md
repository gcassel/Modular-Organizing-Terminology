* [_item_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/item.md)
* [_instance_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md): Instances are often units, and units are often instances. However, the [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) of _instance_ isn't [directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to the [_definition_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/definition.md) _of types_, which creates _units_.
