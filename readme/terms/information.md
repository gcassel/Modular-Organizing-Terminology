# information

**Definition**

_Information_ consists of [_related_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) __ [_elements_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) _and_ [_forms_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) which _are_ [_actively_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) _present and discretely_ [_identifiable_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) within one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Notes**

8/16/19: _Information_ is being deprioritized in MOT in favor of the more specialized term [_data_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md), which in this author's opinion avoids the philosophical problems involved in usefully defining (and limiting) _information_. Therefore, _information_ will probably be delinked from many or most uses.

2017: My much longer description of "information" elsewhere is gradually being updated, and may or may not be added here. I find it difficult to create a [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) definition which _accurately and sufficiently_ [_describes_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) __ [_physical_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md)_,_ [_mental_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mental.md) _and_ [_social_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) _information._ For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), physical information is active within physical contexts and mental information is active within [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) contexts, _but_ social contexts are physically _mediated_ (often via [signs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sign.md) carried by [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md)). I'll keep working on the variables.
