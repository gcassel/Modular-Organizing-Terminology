# release

**Definition**

A _release_, or _release_ [_edition_](edition.md), is a [_product_](../../terms/product.md) which _has been released for_ [_unregulated_](regulate.md) _use_ in its [naming](name.md) [context](context.md).

**Notes**

If a release is a [protocol](protocol.md), a [specific](specific.md) [collective](collective.md) might expect all [participants](participate.md) to use it in one or more specific [activities](activity.md).

Products with extensive [developmental](develop.md) history often have a [sequence](sequence.md) of releases which use strict numerical naming systems.
