# complexity

**Definitions**

_Complexity_ is a [compound](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compound.md) [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) which [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) _variety_, _frequency_ and _amplitude_ of [_grouping_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) _and/or_ [_interaction_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) within a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).

_Complex_ is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of forms which have _high complexity_ within a [specific](specific.md) [context](context.md).

**Notes**

Complexity can create [predictable](predict.md) _or_ unpredictable [conditions](status.md).

Complexity can be [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) as an un[limit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md)ed positive dimension with the [parameters](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/parameter.md) of zero (for complete chaos) and _infinity_.

Complexity via variety can arise through a relatively small number of complex relationships; i.e., only two elements [interact](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md), but they interact quite differently depending on each element's current [status](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/status.md) and/or the [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) in which the interaction occurs.

Complexity can rarely be [measured](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/measure.md) effectively except in relatively _less-complex_ (and artificial) [_design_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) __ [_contexts_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
