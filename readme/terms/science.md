# science

**Definition**

_Science_ is [_systematic_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) __ [_theorizing_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/theorize.md) which is [based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) on [_experience_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md)_,_ [_research_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/research.md) _and_ [_controlled_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/control.md) __ [_experimentation_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experiment.md).

**Notes**

It's quite difficult to [effectively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md) control experiments which are [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) or unintentionally based on extremely [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [concepts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md). This applies to complex [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) concepts, but [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) to [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) concepts, because they're often based on questionable [assumptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assume.md) about physical experience.

Theory which _can't be_ [_falsified_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/contradict.md) is [_inherently_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inherent.md) _unscientific_.
