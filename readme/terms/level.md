# level

**Definition**

A level is a [_network_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) _of_ [_organized_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md) __ [_elements_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which _occupies a_ [_position_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/position.md) within an [_ordered_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/order.md) __ [_set_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md), [_system_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/system.md) and/or [_hierarchy_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md).

**Notes**

Each level gives one or more [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) to any higher levels which are [based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) on it. The base level may or may not [govern](govern.md) the higher level.

At least two levels are [present](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/presence.md) in all [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md), because each system has one or more [emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emerge.md) [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) which are not present in its [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md).

Levels often include, define or describe [sequence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md); however, levels are about [creative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) origination and (when applicable) [governance](govern.md), not sequence per se.

Relationships _between_ levels are often described [simply](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/simplicity.md) and [generically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) with a few [relational traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relational-trait.md) such as _lower_ and _higher_ or _deeper_ and _higher_. Other [terms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) which relate levels include [_component_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md), [_base_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) and [_extension_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/extend.md).

[Models](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) and [maps](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/map.md) often one level at a much higher [level of detail](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level-of-detail.md) than others. However, it's possible to use a high level of detail in very [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) models, at [risk](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md) of reduced [clarity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/clarity.md) and [legibility](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/legibility.md).
