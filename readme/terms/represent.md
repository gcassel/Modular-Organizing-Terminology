# represent

**Definition**

_To represent_ is _to_ [_report_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/report.md) _or_ [_design_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) __ [_information_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) _with_ [_signs_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sign.md), including [symbols](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/symbol.md), which _re-present_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_elements_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).

**Specialized Meaning**

_A representation_ is _a_ [_form_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) _which represents another form._

**Notes**

Representations usually represent forms. They can only represent unformed or pure elements within well-[defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Representations often represent forms by using different elements and [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md); however, a representation may re-use any number of [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md).

Representation often [translates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/translate.md) elements into [fundamentally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) different [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md). For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), we often represent [experiential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) elements as [ideas](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/idea.md) which we [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) _to each other_ with [concepts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md)-- and, our concepts often represent [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md), [mental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mental.md) _and_ [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [experiences](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md).
