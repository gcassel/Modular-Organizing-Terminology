**Definition**

An _operating system_ is a [_system_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) _of_ [_programs_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/program.md) which [_governs_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) _the_ [_functions_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) _of a_ [_system_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).

**Specialized Definition**

_Operating system_ is [especially](specialize.md) [associated](associate.md) with [computers](computer.md), although any [_complex_](complex.md) _system_ may have one.

A computer operating system often (but not necessarily) [enables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to [directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) [access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md), and to [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [modify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modify.md), many or most of a computer's functions.
