# cost

**Definition**

Cost is a [_dimensional_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) __ [_trait_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) which [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) the _practically irreversible loss of one or more_ [_agent's_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) _subsequent_ [_ability_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ability.md) _to_ [_use_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) _a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_resource_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) due to [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) which affects that resource.

**Notes**

Cost is a trait of actions and activities which alter, destroy, or remove access to a resource. [Potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) actions may be [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) by [describing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) their potential costs (or [risks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md)). [Reports](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/report.md) of _past_ actions may describe cost(s) which were [experienced](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) or directly [measured](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/measure.md).

Each cost can be indirectly or directly translated into a monetary total for the (inherently situational) fair market value of a resource which has been lost. Such calculations are straightforward for monetary and material resources. Theyâ€™re difficult for social resources; however, rough estimates (which allow broad margins for error!) can be very useful when making difficult decisions.

[_Benefit_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/benefit.md) is a complementary [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md).

[_Risk_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md) may be considered a [subtype](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subtype.md) of cost.
