# live-communication

**Definition**

_Live communication_ is [communication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communicate.md) in which [_signals_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) _are_ [_transmitted_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md) __ [_immediately_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/immediate.md) from at least one [_sending_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/send.md) __ [_agent_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to at least one [_receiving_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/receive.md) _agent_.

**Notes**

Both [_direct_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) _"in person" communications_ and [_telecommunications_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/telecommunicate.md) may be _live_.

In many or most live communications [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) are [mutually](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mutual.md) [able](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ability.md) to immediately [send](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/send.md) _and_ [receive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/receive.md) signals to each other. However, many tools and techniques enable agents to send live signals to receivers who aren't [enabled](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) to [directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) _respond_. (For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), that's often the case with news broadcasts.)
