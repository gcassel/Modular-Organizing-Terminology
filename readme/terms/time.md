**Definition**

_Time_ is the [_dimension_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) _of_ [_changing_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/change.md) __ [_experience_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md).

**Specialized Meaning**

The [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) _time_, and [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) including it, are often used as [_relational traits_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relational-trait.md) which [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) the [_position_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/position.md) _in local time_ that [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) or [events](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md) occurred, or are [planned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) for. (For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a [person](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) may state that they walked to the park at the time of 4:30 pm, or a [computer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/computer.md) may [record](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/record.md) that a file's _time_ [_received_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/receive.md) was 8:28 am on 5 Feb 2017.)

**Notes**

[Persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) often [experience](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) [time](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/time.md) _and_ [spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md) [_based_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) _on_ a [_conceived_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) __ [_sequence_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) _of (also conceived)_ [_events_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md). Each conceived [step](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/step.md) in such sequences [tends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tend.md) to [_practically_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/practice.md) _disregard_ the space between _quickly_ [_interacting_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) __ [_physical_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) __ [_elements_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).

Because the distance between quickly interacting elements is normally disregarded, the [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) _time_ is much more commonly [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) than the more [_socially_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) __ [_basic_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) and [_accurate_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accurate.md) term _spacetime_.
