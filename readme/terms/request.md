**Notes**

For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), agents often request _other agents'_ [_time_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/time.md)_, attention and/or the_ [_performance_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) _of_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_actions_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md). Those are all resources. Agents also often request _the_ [_development_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) _of_ [_agreements_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agree.md), and agreements _create rights_.

Requests often [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to either [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) _or_ [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) resources.

Requests often occur within [_mandatory_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) __ [_contexts_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) such as [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [exchanges](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/exchange.md).
