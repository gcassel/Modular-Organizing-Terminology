# trait

**Definition**

A trait is a [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_behavior_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/behave.md) _which an_ [_element_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) _will_ [_exhibit_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/exhibit.md) in one or more [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Notes**

Traits cause specific [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) in specific [conditions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/condition.md). Traits are the primary way to [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) unless theyâ€™re [systematically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) described from a [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) or [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) perspective.

Depending on [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), traits can be [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) or [emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emerge.md). Some traits of [_language_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md) _elements_, including all [_representational_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) _elements_, are [inherent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) by design. By contrast, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [_develop_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) __ [_claims_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/claim.md) of _emergent traits_ [uncertainly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/probability.md) by _(inductively)_ [_conceiving_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) __ [_relationships_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) _and_ [_patterns_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/pattern.md). Such conceived traits are technically [attributes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/attribute.md) which _can't_ be indisputably proven, and often can't be _disproven_ either. Nonetheless, some attributes may be [_confidently_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/confidence.md) _and_ [_usefully_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) __ [_agreed_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agree.md) _upon_ by all agents within a specific [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) context.

For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), almost all (awake) [persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) seem to predictably [_experience_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) _mass_ as a trait of [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) _matter_, and experience _weight_ as an additional trait of matter within a _gravitational_ _field_.

The context of [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) emergent traits is often [implied](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/imply.md) and un[stated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md). While [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/agent.md) may [believe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/belief.md) that specific traits (even their own) are [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) in most if not all [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) contexts, only the most [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) and [accurate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) traits may approach that ideal of _universality_.

Traits are conceived and [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) by identifying [significantly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) interactive relationships between elements.
