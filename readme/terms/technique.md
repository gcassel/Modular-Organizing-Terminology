# technique

**Definitions**

_A technique_ or _method_ is a [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) which an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) can [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) _to_ [_create_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) _a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_action_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md), or to creatively _pursue a specific_ [_goal_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md).

_Technical_ is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of any process or [problem](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/problem.md) which is _(1)_ [_inherent_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) _to or (2) highly_ [_predictable_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) _within a specific_ [_context_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/contexst.md), due to _non-_[_personal_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) _and non-_[_social_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) __ [_factors_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/factor.md).

_Methodical_ is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) which _consistently use a specific method_ in [_clearly_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/clarify.md) __ [_definable_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) __ [_conditions_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/status.md).

**Notes**

A technique is the [type](type.md) of [tool](tool.md) which [facilitates](facilitate.md) the [use](use.md) of other tools; therefore, it's acceptable for the term "tools" to mean "tools and techniques".

Specific techniques often [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) external (non-bodily) [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md), [ingredients](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ingredient.md) and/or [skills](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/skill.md).

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) can [confidently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/confidence.md) [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) non-problematic technical processes _if_ they [consistently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/consistent.md) adhere to all [rules](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rule.md) and [guidelines](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/guideline.md). Likewise, agents can confidently [believe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/believe.md) that a technique _will_ [_fail_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fail.md) if a [crucial](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/crucial.md) technical problem is present.

_Technical_ processes and problems can be [inherent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) to [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md). They can also _seem_ to be inherent to [emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emerge.md) systems, but this is often subject to rapid and unpredictable change. For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a technically reliable process can become unreliable if the context changes, and a technically impossible problem can become possible if the context changes. For example, if it seems technically impossible for a [person](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) to get to work on time, it can become possible (and successful) if a benefactor loans them a working vehicle. _(More examples will help here.)_

Note that a problem is _not_ [primarily](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) technical if it's [based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) on an agent [violating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/violate.md) [accessible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md) [rules](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rule.md).
