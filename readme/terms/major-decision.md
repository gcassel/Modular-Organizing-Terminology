# major-decision

**Definition**

A _Major Decision_ is a decision which has a _gross collective cost_ which exceeds the _greater_ of the following numbers:

1. The Standard Decision Threshold defined by a clearly relevant [post](post.md).
2. The Standard Decision Threshold for a clearly relevant [Project](project.md) which you're a [Member](member.md) of.
3. The General Standard Decision Threshold as defined by the collective Stewards for unspecified expenditures.

**Examples**

If the General Major Decision Threshold is $200 but you have a post which allows you to spend up $400 for a clearly defined purpose, then spending $360 within the Scope of that Position is a [Standard Decision](standard-decision.md).

If the General Major Decision Threshold is $200 but your Project has a Major Project Decision Threshold of $500, then spending $300 would be a Standard Decision.

If the General Major Decision Threshold is $200 but your Project has a Major Project Decision Threshold of $500, then spending $510 would be a Major Decision.

**Notes**

Major Decisions require the permission of the Collective Stewards.
