# level-of-detail

**Definition**

Level of detail is a [dimensional variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimensional-variable.md) which [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) _how much of the_ [_complexity_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md) _in a_ [_form_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) _has been_ [_described_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Notes**

Level of detail often [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) refers to descriptions which _are_ [_models_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md).

The dimensional variability of level of detail is often described [simply](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/simplicity.md) and [generically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) with a few [relational traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relational-trait.md) such as _lower_ and _higher_.

Models which describe _higher_ [_hierarchical_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) __ [_levels_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level.md) often describe their lower levels of organization with a lower level of detail. However, it's possible to use a high level of detail in extremely complex models (at some risk of reduced [clarity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/clarify.md)).
