# federate

**Definitions**

_To federate_ is _to_ [_create_](create.md) _a_ [_collective_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) _which_ [_includes_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) _other collectives_.

_A federation_ is _an_ [_alliance_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/alliance.md) _of collectives which_ [_recognize_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recognize.md) _a_ [_coordinating_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordinate.md) _collective._

**Notes**

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [_create_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) _a federation_ by [_developing_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) _a coordinating collective_ which [_governs_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md) __ [_specifications_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) for other collectives to [_participate_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) _in_, and potentially [_identify_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) _as a_ [_member_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/member.md) _of_, the federation. Depending on the [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) of the federation, such member collectives might or might not be [member-agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/member-agent.md).

The definition above is [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md). “Federation” has been applied to many [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) alliances with [varying](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md). For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), the coordinating agent of a federation [might](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/might.md) [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) that member groups [_may_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/may.md) __ [_act_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) _only as subordinate_ [_subgroups_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subform.md) of the coordinating agent in some [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md). However, some self-[identified](identify.md) "federations" are alliances in which membership is (outside of extreme controversies) purely self-[assigned](assign.md), and in which the member collectives always act [autonomously](autonomy.md). Such alliances are not federations by this MOT [definition](define.md).

Loosely-coupled federations, in which the member collectives do _not_ submit to potentially [coercive](coerce.md) forms, can be called _confederations_. However, this term is old fashioned, potentially confusing and probably unnecessary.
