A computing _kernel_ [may](may.md) [suffice](suffice.md) to [_create_](create.md) _an operating system_, but [designers](design.md) often [modify](modify.md) and [develop](develop.md) kernels to reflect the [specialized](specialize.md) [requirements](require.md) and [recommendations](recommend.md) of [personal](personal.md) and [collective](collective.md) [agents](agent.md) such as [software](software.md) companies.
