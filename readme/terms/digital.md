# digital

**Definition**

_Digital_ is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) (and of [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md)) which [_represent_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) __ [_information_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) _as a_ [_sequence_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) _of 0s and 1s_.

**Notes**

Digital data often represents [qualitative variables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/qualitative-variable.md). For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), each of the 26 letters in the English alphabet (and of many alphabets) is digitally represented via the [Unicode standard](http://unicode.org/standard/standard.html). Digital data _also_ often represents [dimensional variables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimensional-variable.md). For example, [_analog_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/analog.md) __ [_signals_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) are often represented as digital data.

Digital data is never identical to analog data. However, the _information loss_ (and the resulting [_significance_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) _of abstraction_) of digital data can be [_practically_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) _eliminated_ by encoding with sufficient _bit depth_. Digital data isn't subject to the _predictable and inevitable_ [_degradation_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/degrade.md) which analog data experiences when repeatedly [replicated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/replicate.md), [transmitted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md) or [processed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md), so digital data is a [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) of most large _signaling and_ [_computing_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compute.md) __ [_networks_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md).
