# position

**Definition**

Position is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) which [_represents_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) _an_ [_element's_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) __ [_value(s)_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/value.md) _within one or more_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_dimensions_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md).

**Notes**

Position may represent either [_ordinal_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/order.md) _or_ [_interval_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) value. In interval [measurement](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/measure.md), however, position [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) represents either a [_point_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/point.md) or _an interval of extremely small_ [_scope_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md) within the [_active_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) _dimension_. This extreme specialization contrasts with the [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) _large_ relative scope of a [location](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/location.md) within a dimension.

[_post_](post.md): Posts are often called positions in specific [collectives](collective.md). This is fine as long as [meanings](mean.md) are [mutually](mutual.md) [understood](understand.md); however, MOT must reserve the term _position_ for its much more [generic](generic.md) and [flexible](flexible.md) usage here.
