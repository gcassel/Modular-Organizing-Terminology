A *species* is a [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of living organism which can (either *sexually* or *asexually*) reproduce a changeable but generically identifiable type of genetic code with other [members](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/member.md) of that species, but not with other species (except in rare cases of closely related hybridization).
