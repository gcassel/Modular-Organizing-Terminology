# property

**Definition**

A property is an [_required_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) __ [_trait_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) _of an_ [_element_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Examples**

* Product X is a green shirt. Green is currently a property of the shirt.
* The [_quantity_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/quantity.md) _of 3_ is a property of _a_ [_group_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) _of three cats_.
* _Mass_ is a property of [matter-energy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/matter-energy.md).

**Notes**

_Property_ is often [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to _the_ [_concept_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) _of_ [_ownership_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/own.md). However, that concept is de-emphasized in [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/) in favor of [_distributed_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) __ [_access_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md) _and_ [_usage_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) __ [_rights_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md) _and_ [_responsibilities_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/responsibility.md).

The _inherent_ nature of a property in an active element does not imply _inevitability_. Properties can change via [transmutation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmute.md), [transformation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transform.md) and [emergence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md). Nonetheless, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may often dis[agree](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agree.md) about what is or _isn't_ inherent in-- and thus, a property and not an [**attribute**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/attribute.md) of--a specific element. _Attribute_ is [recommended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommend.md) for traits which aren't clearly and uncontroversially inherent to an element within a specific context.

I suggest a [formally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) [strict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) approach which only [_assigns_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) _properties_ based on _deductive_ reasoning and analysis. I suggest identifying all _inductive and abductive qualitative claims_ as attributes which are _not_ properties. (However, I don't consider it MOT's role to strictly prescribe terminology.)
