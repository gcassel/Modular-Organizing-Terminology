# standard-decision

**Definition**

A _Standard Decision_ is a decision which (1) is _not_ clearly within the limits of a Minor Decision, but (2) _clearly does not exceed_ the highest of any following values:

* any applicable Personal Standard Decision Authorizations
* any applicable Team Standard Decision Authorizations
* (if implemented) the Collective Standard Decision Authorization

**Examples**

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20 and its Standard Decision Authorization is $200, then it would be a Standard Decision to give $50 of sample products to a customer.

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20 and its Standard Decision Authorization is $200, but you have a personal [post](post.md) to distribute up to $50 of free samples per week, then it would be a Standard Decision for you to distribute more than $50, but less than $200, of samples per week.

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20 and its Standard Decision Authorization is $200, but you're acting outside of the scope of your [team](team.md) [roles](role.md) _and_ your personal post(s), then distributing $50 of samples would be a Standard Decision.

**Notes**

Agents should document every Standard Decision which changes any resources which we track on spreadsheets, including inventory items.
