# section

**Definition**

_A section_ is _a_ [_region_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/region.md) _in a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_form_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).

**Notes**

_Section_ is an [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) extremely [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md).

[_Designed_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) sections may [accurately](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) [_emergent_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) __ [_organization_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organize.md), but they may also disregard or [contradict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/contradict.md) it. For example, [perceiving](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) a tree trunk as a stack of cross-sectional disks does not directly represent any [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of a tree's form, although it could [indicate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) patterns of vertical [symmetry](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/symmetry.md).
