**Definition**

_A bot_ is a [software](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/software.md) [program](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/program.md) which [_performs_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) __ [_automated_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/automate.md) __ [_processes_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) _on a multi-_[_agent_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) __ [_computing_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compute.md) __ [_network_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md)_._

**Specialized Definition**

Bots may often [_perform_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) __ [_roles_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) _which have been_ [_designed_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) _for_ [_agents_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).

**Notes**

Bots often perform [actions](act.md) which are or _aren't_ [officially](official.md) permitted _or_ [restricted](restrict.md) in a [specific](specific.md) [social](social.md) [context](context.md).

Examples: Bots often perform repetitive [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) such as the _web-crawling_ which [builds](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) many web _search engine_ [_indices_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/index.md). Bots are also [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) sometimes to exploit online [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) which [generate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generate.md) [desired](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) [currencies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/currency.md). This often happens in _multiplayer online game_ [_economies_](https://github/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/economy.md).

Bots may be _officially_ [_assigned_](assign.md) as [_valid_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/valid.md) __ [_delegates_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/delegate.md) for [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) within [strictly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/definition.md) contexts.

As increasingly [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) and [adaptive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/adapt.md) [abilities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ability.md) are developed for bots, they may perform increasingly [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) and [varied](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) roles for agents.
