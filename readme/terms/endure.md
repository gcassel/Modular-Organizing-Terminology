# endure

**Definitions**

_To endure_ is _to remain_ [_present_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/presence.md) _within a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_context_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) _throughout a specific_ [_period_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md).

_Duration_ is _the_ [_period_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md) _which a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_element_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) _endures_ within a specific context.

_Durability_ is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) which [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) the [_relative_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) __ [_predicted_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) _duration_ of a specific element as compared to [alternatives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/alternative.md).

**Notes**

_Endure_ and [_persist_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md) are practically equivalent (and, don't need separate formal definitions), but _durable_ and _persistent_ are not equivalent. (_Persistent_ is a [strictly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of _durable_.)

The context within which an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) endures _may have widely_ [_variable_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) _temporal limits_. For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), an ocean may endure indefinitely on a specific planet, depending on climate-- but it would not survive the planet's [destruction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/destroy.md). Likewise, elements may endure indefinitely during very _brief_ but _contextually_ [_crucial_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/crucial.md) [intervals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md).

**Related Terms**

* _permanence_: [Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) _permanence_ in [ways](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) which are [practically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/practice.md) synonymous with _durable_ or _persistent_. However, _permanence_ has also often been used for (non-logical) [claims](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/claim.md) about [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) supposedly lasting forever, or existing outside of the [_spacetime_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md) _continuum_.
