*To violate* is *to break a [rule](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rule.md)* in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
		
**Notes:**  

The [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) of *violation* is [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) in many [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md), [cultural](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/culture.md), [economic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/economy.md) and [political](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/politics.md) contexts.

[Describing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) an [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) as a *violation* does *not* [necessarily](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md) [indicate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) that the action was [damaging](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md) or inappropriate.  However, violations may [automatically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/automate.md) initiate the use of *judiciary* or *conflict resolution* [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md).
