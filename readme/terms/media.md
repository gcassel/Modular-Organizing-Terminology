_To mediate_ is _to_ [_transport_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transport.md) __ [_data_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) _or_ [_force_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md) from one [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) to another.

_A medium is an_ [_element_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) _which (1)_ [_includes_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) __ [_data_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) or (2) [_transports_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transport.md) __ [_force_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md).

_Media_ is the [_type_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) _of all_ [_forms_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) _which include data_.

**Notes**

_**Media**_** and **_**media item**_** are** [**uniquely**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) **** [**important**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) **** [**terms**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) **in** [**MOT**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/)**.** They're both nouns based on a verb, but _media_ is nonetheless [established](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/establish.md) as the [root](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/root.md) term (in this [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md)-[focused](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/focus.md) [terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/terminology.md)) because of its [systemic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) importance and [simpler](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/simplicity.md) [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) than any equivalent verb forms. While _media_ is [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) _more_ [_specialized_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) in [MOT](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/) than the plural of medium would be, it is nonetheless an extremely [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) term which can be applied to all "[information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)".

_Media items_ [limitlessly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md) includes [diverse](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/diverse.md) mediums and formats including notes, pamphlets, books, computer programs, and all [recorded](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/record.md) signals such as photographs, etcetera.

Most media [items](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/item.md) have "dual lives" as [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) _and_ [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) forms. While media items can be purely [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md), [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [share](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/share.md) conceptual media by [integrating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/integrate.md) the conceptual forms into physical forms such as sound waves, paper, electrical [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md), memory chips, etcetera. [_Digital_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) _electronic media_, for [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), can often be [replicated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/replicate.md) and [distributed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) with little [cost](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/cost.md) to [senders](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/send.md) or [recipients](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/receive.md).

In addition to inhabiting physical forms, media also often [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) sensory forms such as visual and/or acoustic data. Such sensory forms often further represent [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md) and _nonlanguage_ data.

Most media [items](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/item.md) are [portable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/portable.md); however, media also [includes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) (for [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md)) written inscriptions on buildings and monuments.
