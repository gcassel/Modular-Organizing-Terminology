# train

**Definition**

_To train_ is to [_intentionally_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) __ [_develop_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) _a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_skill_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/skill.md).

[**Potential**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) **** [**Traits**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) **of Training**

Skills can often be developed by directly using them, especially if such use includes [_relevant_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) __ [_variables_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) which [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md) the development of [adaptability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/adapt.md) and _improved_ [_conception_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) of those skills. However, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often use _training_ [_programs_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/program.md) which develop skills in [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md), _repetitive_ and (sometimes) _intentionally varied_ ways.

Training programs are especially associated with (much) training which is [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) or [facilitated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md) _by other agents_, including _teachers_ and _coaches_. However, agents often use self-governed training programs as well as many spontaneous and arbitrary intentional acts of training.
