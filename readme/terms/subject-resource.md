# subject-resource

**Definition**

A _subject resource_ is an _externally-_[_linked_](link.md) __ [_resource_](resource.md) _which is the_ [_official_](official.md) __ [_subject_](subject.md) _of a_ [_specific_](specific.md) __ [_governance resource_](governance-resource.md).

**Notes**

Subject resources can be (but needn't be) defined by [strict](strict.md) [formatting](format.md) [rules](rule.md). They are typically [governed](govern.md) by the same [stewards](steward.md) (or a subgroup thereof) as the governance resources which use them as subjects; however, they can also be autonomously developed and stewarded resources, depending on many variables.
