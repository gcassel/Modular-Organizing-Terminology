# random

**Definitions**

_Random_ is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of _un_[_intentional_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) __ [_elements_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md), and may have two [special](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [meanings](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mean.md):

* as a trait of an element which has entered a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) _without being_ [_selected_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/select.md), and has no specific [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) _cause(s)_.
* as a trait of _unintentional]_ [_order_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/order.md) which _has not been_ [_designed_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md), and has no specific perceived causes.

**Notes**

* [Arbitrary](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/arbitrary.md) is a closely [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) term which is arguably more precise and flexibly [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md).
* Randomized elements will [tend](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tend.md) to be widely [distributed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) or dispersed according to specific criteria. However, this depends on the _size of a_ [_set_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of randomized elements, and will [vary](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) in specific [_instances_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) _of randomization_.
* Whether or not randomness [truly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/true.md) exists is outside of the intended [scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md) of [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/).
