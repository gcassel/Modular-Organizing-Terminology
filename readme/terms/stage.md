# stage

**Definition**

A _stage_ is _the_ [_location_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/location.md) _of a_ [_status_](status.md) in a [_sequence_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) _of_ [_processes_](process.md).

**Notes**

A _stage_ can be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) by the [steps](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/step.md) which have already been [completed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complete.md) and the step which should occur next.

_Stage_ is often [associated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/associate.md) with highly [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) and [complicated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complicate.md) processes and [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md). Such processes and systems often [include](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) many [substructural](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/substructure.md) sequential _and_ [parallel](parallel.md) processes. Substructural sequential processes can have any number of stages of their own.
