# principle

**Definition**

_A principle_ is _an_ [_assumption_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assume.md) _or_ [_belief_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/believe.md) _about how to_ [_effectively_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md) __ [_act_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), either to [support](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) a specific [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) or universally.

**Notes**

Principles are often based upon other principles. Those principles are sometimes based on yet other principles, but can also be [intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) or unintentional assumptions or [premises](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/premise.md).

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often [_base_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) _the_ [_development_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) of [_specifications_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md)_,_ [_standards_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard.md)_,_ [_agreements_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agree.md), and many other [organizational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) on principles. Therefore, agents may find it [efficient](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/efficient.md) to [_directly_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) __ [_discuss_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dialogue.md) _principles_ before [collaborating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaborate.md) on specific [designs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md).

**Related Terms**

**values**: Values is often [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) as a synonym for _principles_ in some [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) contexts. However, [_value_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/value.md) has a different [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) in [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/).
