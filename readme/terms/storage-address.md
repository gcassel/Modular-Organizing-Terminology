# storage-address

**Definition**

_A storage address_ is _an_ [_address_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/address.md) _which_ [_identifies_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) _a_ [_storage-_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md)[_location_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/location.md)_._

Storage addresses [_enable_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) __ [_agents_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to [_persistently_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md) _store,_ [_organize_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organize.md)_, sort, filter and search for_ [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) contained within [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md).

**Notes**

Storage addresses are [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) by _one or more_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_agents_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md). In fact it's quite common for the governance of storage addresses to be ([officially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) _or_ unofficially) shared between two or more agents who do not [_create_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) _a_ [_collective_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md)_,_ nor otherwise create any [_decision_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decide.md) __ [_rule(s)_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rule.md) regarding the [_modification_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modify.md) _of_ [_data_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) within the storage address. Such in[formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) approaches can often be [sustainable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) _in the absence of persistent_ [_conflict_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/conflict.md) between the governing agents.

_Specific_ [_media_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) __ [_items_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/item.md) are often closely [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to specific storage addresses. However, close relationships are not inevitable. For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), [Inclusive Framework](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1-WFMRYdueSBba1atcohX0G585zj-gBNlBvZQBqnEmEs/edit?usp=sharing) [recommends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommend.md) a _distributed hosting_ [_model_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) which could [liberate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/independent.md) [shared](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/common.md) media items from dependence on any specific storage addresses.
