# goal

**Definition**

_A goal_ is _an_ [_intended_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) __ [_action_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) _or_ [_state_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/status.md).

**Notes**

Each goal can be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) with action which [_creates_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md)_,_ [_maintains_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/maintain.md)_,_ [_governs_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md)_,_ [_transforms_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transform.md)_,_ [_eliminates_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/eliminate.md) _or_ [_intentionally_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) __ [_damages_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md) one or more [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md), [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) and agents. Thus, goals always relate to [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) with [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) and [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md). However, major goals often requires unpredictable creative [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md), which makes it [practically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/practice.md) impossible to accomplish them [automatically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/automate.md) via specific [plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md).

[Importantly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md), the [systemic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) pursuit of creative goals often [requires](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) highly predictable [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) which _can_ be automated.

Individuals often engage in the solitary pursuit of [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) goals. Shared goals are often the subject of [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md), [cultural](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/culture.md), [economic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/economic.md) and [political](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/politics.md) [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) including [communication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communicate.md), [coordination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordinate.md) and [collaboration](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaborate.md) [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md).

Shared goals may often include creatively co-exploring ideas and shared interests _without_ attempting to reach mutually shared conclusions or (more [formally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)) creating [group decisions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group-decision.md). Such non-conclusive exploration is the [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) nature of a ‘discussion [forum](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/forum.md)’, and of many other social [networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) and [communities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md).
