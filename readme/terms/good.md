# good

**Definition**

_A good_ is _a_ [_resource_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) _which can be_ [_offered_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/offer.md) _for_ [_potential_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) __ [_transfer_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transfer.md).

**Notes**

Goods are distinguished by _transferability_; by contrast, [services](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/serve.md) can't be transferred.

_Goods_ are often [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) and [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md) in [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md).
