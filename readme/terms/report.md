**Definition**

_To report_ is _to_ [_describe_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) _past_ [_actions_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md)_,_ [_experiences_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) _or_ [_research_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/research.md) _to another_ [_agent_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).

Reports are descriptions of past actions, experiences or research which agents [submit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/submit.md) to other agents.

**Notes**

Reports often describe [_complex_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) _actions_ by agents to _fulfill_ [_goals_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) and to _fulfill the_ [_requirements_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) _of_ [_roles_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md).

Reports may include simple [claims](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/claim.md). However, complex reports are usually written as [_interpretive_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interpret.md) __ [_stories_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/story.md) which (inconsistently) [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) available [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md), including [measurements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/measure.md) and [recordings](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/record.md).
