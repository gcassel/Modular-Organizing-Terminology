# constitution

**Definition**

A _constitution_ is _the_ [_primary_](base.md) __ [_governing_](govern.md) __ [_agreement_](agree.md) _of a_ [_collective_](collective.md).

**Notes**

Constitutional [documents](document.md) are often [developed](develop.md) separately instead of [creating](create.md) a single constitution. Separated and [sequential](../../terms/sequential.md) development can often be more [inclusive](include.md) and [efficient](efficient.md).

[Agents](agent.md) [may](may.md) [use](use.md) constitutions to [develop](develop.md) other agreements.

A constitution must [_identify_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) _and_ [_define_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) _the collective_ by [name](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/name.md) and [mission](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mission.md). The constitution should include at least enough [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) [policy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/policy.md) to [protect](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/protect) the collective identity against [predictable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) [risks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md).
