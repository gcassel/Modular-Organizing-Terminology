# task-force

**Definition**

A _task force_ is _a_ [_team_](team.md) _which_ [_commits_](commit.md) _to_ [_performing_](perform.md) _a_ [_specific_](specific.md) __ [_task_](task.md).

**Notes**

Task forces often [serve](serve.md) [collectives](collective.md), although they can [develop](develop.md) [autonomously](autonomy.md). A task force which directly serves a collective is a [specialized](specialize.md) [_type_](type.md) _of_ [_committee_](committee.md). We expect task forces to end when their task is [completed](complete.md); by contrast, many [committees](committee.md) serve indefinitely [enduring](endure.md) [functions](function.md).
