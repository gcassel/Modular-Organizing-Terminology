# coerce

**Definitions**

_To coerce_ is _to_ [_threaten_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/threat.md) _with_ [_restrictive_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restrict.md) __ [_intentions_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md).

_Coercive_ is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of a [role](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) which _would_ [_predictably_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) _coerce_ in a [clearly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/clarify.md) [definable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Notes**

There are two [general](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of coercion which can occur separately or together: _institutional coercion_ and [_social_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) _coercion_.

Institutional coercion includes cases when people are coerced by any [group](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) [rules](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rule.md) which call for [automatic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/automate.md) [punishment](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/punishment.md). Institutional coercion differs from _groupthink_, including moblike [behavior](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/behave.md).

Institutional coercion may cause interpersonal coercion through abused [authority](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authority.md). In other cases, however, it may seem impersonal even if it’s ‘executed’ by a specific person or persons.

Social coercion, by contrast, results from _non-institutional_ [warnings](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/warning.md) or [threats](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/threat.md).

[Persistent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md) interpersonal coercion (i.e., dominance or oppression) can sometimes _derive from_ institutional coercion _if_ individuals have personal coercive [authority](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authority.md) via _officially_ _assigned_ [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md). Such concentrated power often has a corrupting influence.
