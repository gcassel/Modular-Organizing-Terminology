# frequency

**Definitions**

_Frequency_ is a [dimension](dimension.md) which [represents](represent.md) _how often a_ [_potential_](potential.md) __ [_action_](act.md) _occurs within a_ [_specific_](specific.md) __ [_context_](context.md).

**Notes**

Frequency is often [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) or [calculated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/calculate.md) within the [limits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md) of specific [periods](period.md). However, it can also [represent](represent.md) frequency _throughout the_ [_predicted_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) __ [_duration_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/endure.md) _of a specific potential action_. For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) could predict that [accidents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accident.md) of a specific [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) will occur rarely or never during a specific period of heightened vigilance, but that such actions will occur at Frequency X over the entire duration of Activity 1.
