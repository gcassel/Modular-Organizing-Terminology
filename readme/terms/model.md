# model

**Definition**

_To model_ is _to_ [_represent_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) __ [_perceived_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) _or_ [_predicted_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) __ [_relationships_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) _between_ [_forces_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md) _and_ [_forms_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).

_A model_ is _a representation of perceived or predicted relationships between forces and forms._

**Notes**

Models often [include](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) [constant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/constant.md) _and_ [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) elements.

Models can represent all [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) and [mental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mental.md) relationships. They can represent past, present and future, and they can represent [emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emerge.md) (“natural”) or [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) (artificial) relationships, including [imaginative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/imagine.md) fiction.

A model is a [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) which is [valued](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/value.md) for representing other resources and, sometimes, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).

**Generic Example**

A model may represent a [probability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/probability.md) which no one designed and no one [desires](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md), but which nonetheless seems to be an [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) element of [shared](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/common.md) [experience](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md).
