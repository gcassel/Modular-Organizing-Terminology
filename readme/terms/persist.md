# persist

**Definitions**

_To persist_ is _to remain_ [_present_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/presence.md) _throughout a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_period_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md).

_Persistent_ is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of any [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which _is_ [_predicted_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) _to remain indefinitely present_ in a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Notes**

_Persistent_ is a [_strictly_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) __ [_specialized_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) __ [_type_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) _of_ [_durable_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/endure.md). A persistent element is [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) to be so durable that any [probability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/probability.md) of ending, such as [_functional_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) __ [_failure_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fail.md), can be [effectively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md) ignored for a specific [_period_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md) _of prediction_.

Persistent is often a [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) trait in [strict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md), [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) for [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) [_data_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) instead of [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md). This is partly because [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) data can be indefinitely [replicated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/replicate.md) and [distributed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) across many network [nodes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/node.md), [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [including](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) [autonomous](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/autonomy.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) and [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [redundant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/redundancy.md) nodes. Distribution and redundancy can greatly reduce [risks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md) of failure. Such [security](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/secure.md) can be developed in many systems, including biological reproduction, [computing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compute.md) systems and "word of mouth" [communication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communicate.md).

* [_temporary_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/temporary.md)
* _permanence_: [Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) _permanence_ in [ways](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) which are [practically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/practice.md) synonymous with _durable_ or _persistent_. However, _permanence_ has also often been used for (non-logical) [claims](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/claim.md) about [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) supposedly lasting forever, or existing outside of the [_spacetime_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md) _continuum_.
