# distributed-computing

**Definition**

_Distributed computing_ is [_computing_](compute.md) _which is_ [_distributed_](distribute.md) __ [_equitably_](equity.md) _among all_ [_participants_](participate.md) in a [specific](specific.md) computing [activity](activity.md).

**Notes**

Fully distributed computing [requires](require.md) distributed [_signaling_](signal.md)_,_ [_processing_](process.md) _and_ [_storing_](store.md) _of_ [_data_](data.md).

As of this writing (20 Feb 2019), fully distributed computing has only been prototyped and practiced at small [scales](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scale.md). However, some aspects of distributed computing have already happened on massive scales; for [example](example.md), distributed [file](file.md)-[sharing](share.md) via Bittorrent and similar [protocols](protocol.md).
