[**Specialized**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) **** [**Meaning**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mean.md)

_Voting_ is especially associated with contexts in which _specific agents_ are assigned to specific [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) in a [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md). However, the [definition](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/definition.md) of voting here is flexibly [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) for other contexts, including [_consent-based_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/consent-based.md) __ [_decision_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decide.md) __ [_processes_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md).
