# timekeeper

**Definition**

_Timekeeper_ is the [role](role.md) of _helping to_ [_facilitate_](facilitate.md) _or_ [_govern_](govern.md) _an_ [_event_](event.md) by [_monitoring_](monitor.md) _and_ [_reporting_](report.md) _the passage of time_.

**Note**

The role of timekeeper can be [defined](define.md) to be [directly](direct.md) [subordinate](subordinate.md) to a facilitator role. It can also be defined independently, allowing [agents](agent.md) to un[officially](official.md) [manage](manage.md) [relationships](relate.md) between facilitators and timekeepers.

Timekeepers are mainly [used](use.md) for [meetings](meet.md), although they can be useful for any events (including many games and sports) which [include](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) very time-sensitive relationships.
