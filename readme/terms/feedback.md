# feedback

Feedback is an [_output_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md) _which becomes an_ [_input_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) within a [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_process_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md).

**Notes:**

_Positive feedback_ increases the speed of a specific process, potentially at an [explosive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/explode.md) rate. _Negative feedback_ decreases the speed of a specific process.

Feedback [directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) _or_ indirectly result from inputs. (For example, positive feedback loops can result from outputs which go through several [filters](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/filter.md) before becoming inputs again, if the output still has a clearly [perceptible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) influence on the filtered feedback.)
