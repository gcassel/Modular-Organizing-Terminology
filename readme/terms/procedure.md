# Definition

A _procedure_ is a [_sequence_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) _of_ [_processes_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) which _each_ [_performs_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) _a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_function_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) within the sequence.

For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a specific procedure may emerge from the sequential [performance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) of Process 1, Process 2 and _then_ Process 3.
