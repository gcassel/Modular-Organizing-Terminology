# framework

**Definition**

_A framework_ is a [_network_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) _of_ [_frames_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/frame.md) which [_functions_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) _as a_ [_base_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) to [_enable_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) _or_ [_facilitate_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md) the [hierarchical](hierarchy.md) (and, sometimes, [modular](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/module.md)) [development](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) of a [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_system_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).

**Notes**

A _framework_ functions by [_linking_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md) _frames_ which each hold a formal [component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) which can develop in various ways, depending on the framework's [specification](specification.md). A framework is, technically, a component itself; it’s a component which provides “[connective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/connect.md) tissue” (and, often, creates connective [issues](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/issue.md).)

Frameworks can be used to develop many [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) and [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md).

A framework can [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) as the basis of a [recipe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recipe.md).

It’s often unnecessary and undesirable to [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) or [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) a framework for a small system of components which are directly connected to each other, or are very simply connected via unspecialized [mediums](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) or [channels](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/channel.md). However, most science and engineering--and much other design work, too-- is implicitly based on designing or describing a framework of reasonably well-defined components, interfaces and connectors (mediums, links or channels). This is the standard, tried-and-true way of designing or describing highly complex and specialized structures, whether with strictly separated machine parts or the fluids, membranes and biochemistry of organisms.

**Related Terms**

[_template_](template.md): Templates are often frameworks. However, templates don't necessarily include frames, so they're not always frameworks. Frameworks aren't necessarily templates, but they often include templates and can be templates. For example, a web framework is a developmental framework which often includes default or even "boilerplate" code modules, which are customizable templates.

[_policy_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/policy.md)_,_ [_protocol_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/protocol.md): Policies and protocols are often [primary](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) of frameworks. (Note also that policies often contain protocols.)
