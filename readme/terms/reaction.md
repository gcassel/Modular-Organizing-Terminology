# reaction

**Definition**

Reaction is [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) which is _caused by other_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) _action(s)_.

**Notes**

_Action-reaction_ [_relationships_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) can sometimes be [_usefully_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) __ [_identified_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) in [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) which contain [_sequential_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) __ [_processes_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md).

Most reactions can be more [accurately](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) and [precisely](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) identified as [factors](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/factor.md) in [parallel](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/parallel.md) processes which _simultaneously influence all acting_ [_elements_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md), including any [participating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md), in [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) _unpredictable_ ways. However, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) "actions" and "reactions" in parallel processes to [_intentionally_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) __ [_limit_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md) __ [_complexity_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md) and to [_prioritize_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/prioritize.md) __ [_functions_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) within specific [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
