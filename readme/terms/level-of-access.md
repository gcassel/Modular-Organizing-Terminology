#### Definition

*Levels of access* are [hierarchies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) determined by [access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md) to seeing or using [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md); they include technical primitives such as _read-write access_ to [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) resources.  

#### Notes

Levels of access include levels of [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) and control, which are probably what most people think of as hierarchy.  A level of access is created any time that a system or agent creates definitive limitations upon the use of one or more resources which they govern, using various means such as passive and active security systems.
