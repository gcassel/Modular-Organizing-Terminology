# average

**Definitions**

_To average_ is _to reduce a_ [_set_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) _of_ [_quantitative_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/quantity.md) __ [_data_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) to an [_element_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) _which_ [_represents_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) _that set_.

_An average_ is _an element which represents a set of quantitative data_.

**Notes**

Many _averaging_ [_formulae_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/formula.md) are [possible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md). However, averaging [tends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tend.md) to be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) with the arithmetic _mean, median and mode_.

Averaging can [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) many [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [searching](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/search.md), [sorting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sort.md) and [filtering](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/filter.md) [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) for a [database](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/database.md).

All averaging formulae are _abstractly reductive_. They [_eliminate_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/eliminate.md) __ [_significant_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) __ [_information_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) from a [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) set.

Instead of averaging, it's often possible (but challenging) to [map](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/map.md) sets of quantities in ways which _do not eliminate information_ and are _highly_ [_clear_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/clarify.md).
