# application

**Definition**

Applications are [_software_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/software.md) __ [_programs_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/program.md) which [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to [_complexly_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) __ [_customize_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) _the_ [_functions_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) _of_ [_computers_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/computer.md), beyond the functions which are [_directly_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) __ [_created_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) by _computer_ [_hardware_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hardware.md) and [_system software_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system-software.md).

**Notes**

An application creates a new [interface](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interface.md) between a computer's [I](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md)/[O](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md) [devices](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md) and its system software . It typically includes a _user interface_ which [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [coordinates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordinate.md) and conceals other [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) of the apps, as well as the system software and the rest of the (non-I/O) hardware which the app [inherently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) [depends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) upon. Such user interfaces intend to enable app users to [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) _clearly_ [_defined_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) _functions_ by intentionally [interacting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interact.md) with nothing other than the computer's I/O devices and the app's user interface.
