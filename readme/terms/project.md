# project

**Definition**

_A project_ is _a_ [_system_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) _with a_ [_specific_](specific.md) __ [_mission_](mission.md).

**Notes**

The system of a project can be relatively simple or informal, such as an unordered list of implicitly supported activities; it can also be extremely elaborate and formalized, as with massive production systems and companies.

Projects are often [defined](define.md) by the intention to [_create_](create.md) _a specific_ [_product_](produce.md).

Projects are [created](create.md) by [persons](person.md), and are usually [officially](official.md) [supported](support.md) by one or more [agents](agent.md). (An unsupported project is often forgotten.)

A project is a system, but the relationships of [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) are often [vaguely](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/vague.md) [understood](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/understand.md) or [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md). Also, not all supporters of "the project" [necessarily](require.md) support the addition of components to that system. (This is a common source of misunderstanding, [confusion](confuse.md), [stress](stress.md) and [conflict](conflict.md).)

Projects often require significant research and development. Each project has a defining mission, but that mission can (with due permission) be changed, and can lead to unexpected results.

Many projects are [collectives](collective.md) which are often defined by constitutional [policies](policy.md), and support many other policies.

A subproject is a project which is [governed](govern.md) by another project.
