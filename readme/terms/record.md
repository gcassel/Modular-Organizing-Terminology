# record

**Definitions**

_To record_ is to [_create_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) __ [_information_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) which [_directly_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) __ [_represents_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) __ [_forces_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md) which are _sensed_ at a [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_physical_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) __ [_location_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/location.md).

_A record_ is _a direct representation of forces which have been sensed at a specific location_.

**Notes**

The recording of _physical forces_ is often [automated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/automate.md) by physical [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md). Automated recordings avoid contamination by the _creative_ [_biases_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/bias.md) of [_persons_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md).

Two [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) are [required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) to create a recording:

* An [analog](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/analog.md) or [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [_measuring_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/measure.md) _tool_ must create [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) which represents [dimensionally variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimensional-variable.md) forces.
* The representative media must be [stored](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md).
