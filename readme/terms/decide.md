# decide

**Definition**

_To decide_ is _to_ [_commit_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/commit.md) _the_ [_use_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) _of a_ [_resource_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) to [_support_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) _a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_action_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md)_,_ [_goal_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) _or_ [_plan_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md).

**Notes**

_Decision_ includes all committed plans to _not act_ in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md). For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), one [could](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/could.md) conclusively decide to not step out of the way of a speeding train, etcetera. Whether one is deciding to act or _not_ act, decisions have [significant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) [influence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/influence.md) on the future.

While [persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) often seem to [_react_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/reaction.md) _unconsciously_ to [experience](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md), they also often make conscious decisions to commit resources to specific actions in the near future. We also frequently decide to commit resources to [sustain](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) goals or plans over the medium to long-term future. Such goals and plans differ greatly in their [adaptability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/adapt.md) to [changing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/change.md) experience.
