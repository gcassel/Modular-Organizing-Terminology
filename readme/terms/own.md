# own

**Definition**

_To own_ is _to have the_ [_potentially_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) __ [_exclusive_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/exclude.md) __ [_right_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md) _to_ [_govern_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) _a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_resource_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) in a specific [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Notes**

Like all [_types_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) _of exclusion_, _ownership_ is closely [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to [_restriction_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restrict.md).

Ownership is a traditional [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md). It's highly [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) to current [legal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/law.md) [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md); however, it's not [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) favored in [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/), which [enables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/enable.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) and [modify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modify.md) more flexible [descriptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) of [rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md), restrictions and [responsibilities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/responsibility.md) regarding [access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md) to specific resources.

Traditional ownership may be _shared_ between two or more people, either as equal peers or via a shareholding model. However, some collectives lack clear and mutually accepted [standards](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/standard.md) for shared ownership and [decision](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/decide.md)-making [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/process.md). Shared owners may often expect [mutual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/mutual.md) [consent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/consent.md) to any unexpected use of the shared resources, _except_ in modern shared ownership forms such as _corporations_ which enable [coercive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/coerce.md) [decisions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/decide.md) to be [authorized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/authorize.md) according to varied [rules](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/rule.md).
