# compound

**Definitions**

_To compound_ is to [_group_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) _separately_ [_identifiable_](identify.md) __ [_elements_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) to [_create_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) _an_ [_emergent_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) __ [_functional_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) __ [_form_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).

_A compound_ is _a group of separately identifiable elements which creates an emergent functional form._

_A composite_ is a compound which consists of relatively large and separately identifiable [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md).

**Notes**

The distinction between compound and composite is rarely of formal value (because it's a slippery slope).

While most if not all [forms](form.md) could [potentially](potential.md) be [perceived](perceive.md) as compounds, the term _compound_ [refers](refer.md) to forms in which all [primary](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) structural [factors](factor.md) seem to have been identified. Example: We call water a compound, because the molecule seems to be entirely created by the chemical bond between one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms. By contrast, we don't normally think of an oil painting as a compound, because it may include many subtle [conceptual](concept.md) and formal elements which are hard to comprehensively identify and relate to each other.
