_To assume_ is to _accept the_ [_validity_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/valid.md) _of a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_concept_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) _within a specific_ [_context_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

[_premise_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/premise.md): _Assumption_ is often nearly synonymous with [premise](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/premise.md). However, premises are always [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to specific [designs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md). Assumptions may be related to [beliefs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/belief.md) or [motivations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/motivate.md) _instead of_ designs.
