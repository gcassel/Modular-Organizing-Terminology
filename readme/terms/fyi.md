**Notes**

FYI can be used as a noun as well as an adjective.

An FYI doesn't necessarily make any [request(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/request.md) of agents who receive the signal. However, it will typically support one or more [channels](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/channel.md) for [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [feedback](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/feedback.md) from its [recipients](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/receive.md).
