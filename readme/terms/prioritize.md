# prioritize

**Definition:**

_To prioritize_ is _to_ [_rank_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rank.md) __ [_goals_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) according to their [_perceived_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) __ [_importance_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Other** [**Forms**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)**:**

_A priority_ is a goal which _ranks highly_ (or _would_ rank highly) in a prioritized list.

**Notes:**

_**Prioritize**_** usually implies a context which includes one or more** [_**sequential**_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) _****_ [_**processes**_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)_**.**_

_Effective_ prioritization often [requires](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) the [identification](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) of an _extremely_ [_specialized_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) _context_.
