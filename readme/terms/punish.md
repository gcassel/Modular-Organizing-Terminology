# punish

**Definitions**

_To punish_ is _to_ [_intentionally_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) __ [_damage_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md) one or more agents because of [belief(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/believe.md) about their _past actions_.

**Notes**

Punishment is sometimes _rationalized_ according to [concepts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) such as _retribution_ and/or _deterrence_.

Punishment differs deeply from concepts such as _remediation_ and _restorative justice_.
