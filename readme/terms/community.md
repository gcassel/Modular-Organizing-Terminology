# community

**Definition**

A community is a [_network_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) _of_ [_agents_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) who all [_use_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) _a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_resource_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md).

**Notes**

_Community_ is an [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) and [flexible](flexible.md) [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) here. For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), this [term](term.md) may refer to diverse and overlapping networks which are related through [diverse](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/diverse.md) resources. However, each community can be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) by the use of a specific resource.

**Communities aren't** [**collectives**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md), although they can contain or [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to any number of collectives. Collectives often seek to [serve](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/serve.md) one or more specific communities, with widely varying degrees of [success](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/succeed.md).
