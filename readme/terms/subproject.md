# subproject

**Definition**

_A subproject_ is _a_ [_project_](project.md) _which is_ [_governed_](govern.md) _by another project._

**Notes**

[Collectives](collective.md) often [delegate](delegate.md) the governance of subprojects to a variety of [official](official.md) [roles](role.md) or [posts](post.md) within the collectives, including shared posts ([teams](team.md)). Also, post-holding [agents](agent.md) often self-organize by creating their own subprojects. [Sustainable](sustain.md) governance and project [management](manage.md) ultimately require clear distinction between the subprojects of collectives and of the projects and roles _within_ them.

Project and subproject relationships can extend indefinitely throughout the [hierarchical](hierarchy.md) [levels](level.md) of a large collective.
