# minor-decision-2.0

**Definition**

A _Minor Decision_ is a decision which has _a gross collective_ [_cost_](cost.md) which _clearly does not exceed_ the _highest_ of any following values:

1. an applicable Personal Minor Decision Authorization
2. an applicable Team Minor Decision Authorization
3. (if implemented) the Collective Minor Decision Authorization

**Examples**

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20, then it would be a Minor Decision to give $18-$19 of sample products to a customer.

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20 but you have a personal Accountability to distribute up to $50 of free samples per week, then it would be a Minor Decision to distribute any samples until that limit is hit.

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20 but you're acting outside of the scope of your Project's Accountabilities _and_ your personal Accountabilities, then distributing _any_ free samples would be a non-Minor Decision. (Probably a [Standard Decision](standard-decision.md), unless you're giving away a huge amount of products.)
