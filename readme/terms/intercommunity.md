# intercommunity

**Definition**

_Intercommunity_ is _the_ [_networking_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) _of_ [_communities_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md)_._

**Notes**

Most if not all communities already have in[direct](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) and un[official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) networked [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) with each other. Many communities also are directly related via the [official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md).

The [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) _intercommunity_ reflects the [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) that _all group agents are_ [_designed_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) (and [inherently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inherent.md) _artificial_.) To fully explore intercommunity [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md), [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) could combine [_consent-based_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/consent-based.md) __ [_decision_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decide.md) __ [_process_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) with [inclusive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) [options](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/option.md) for [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [_access_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md)_,_ [_participation_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md)_, and_ [_distributed version control_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distributed-version-control.md) for [agreements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agree.md) at all [_hierarchical_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) __ [_levels_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level.md) of [complexly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) related [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) and [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md).   Agents could also [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) _per-_[_person_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) _agreements_ which flexibly [granulate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/granulate.md), aggregate and [iterate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/iterate.md) official relationships across the [limits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md) of existing group agents and networks.

Some "feed-based" [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) activities already suggest the potential [power](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/power.md) of intercommunity.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), people can join and leave many Facebook groups, subreddits or _team chat channels_ whenever they desire to, dynamically customizing their [interactions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) and [experiences](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) with those networks.  Group agents could extend such dynamically [localizing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/localize.md) [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) to the development and [distribution](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) of consent-based agreements, as well as the [discussion](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dialogue.md) [topics](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/topic.md), [forums](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/forum.md) and [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md) which agents [link](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md) to them.
