# act

**Definitions**

_To act_ is _to_ [_change_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/change.md) _one or more_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_elements_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) during a specific [period](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md).

_An action_ is an act or [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) which causes _a specific change in an element_ during a specific period.

_Active_ is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of an element which _can_ [_potentially_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) _act_ within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Notes**

Actions can be [classified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/class.md) by these [primary](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md):

[_**compound**_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound.md)_**,**_ [_**create**_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md)_**,**_ [_**destroy**_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/destroy.md)_**,**_ [_**damage**_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md)_**,**_ [_**develop**_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md)_**,**_ [_**emerge**_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emerge.md)_**,**_ [_**modify**_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modify.md)_**,**_ [_**transform**_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transform.md)_**,**_ [_**transmute**_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmute.md)_**,**_ [_**transport**_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transport.md)_**,**_ [_**transmit**_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md)_**,**_ [_**transfer**_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transfer.md)_**,**_ [_**transact**_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transaction.md)

The above types of action [influence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/influence.md) [_agents_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) _and/or_ [_resources_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) in [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md), [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md), [cultural](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/culture.md), [economic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/economy.md) and [political](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/politics.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Agents may directly [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) or _be identified with_ "acts" or "actions" via [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) in [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) social contexts.

Action may be [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) [vaguely](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/vague.md) and gradually _or_ through discrete "quantum" shifts between the [presence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/presence.md) or [absence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/absence.md) of elements, [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) or [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md). Gradual action can be [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) by identifying intervals of time (or [locations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/location.md) in [spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md) _during which_ [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) action occurred.

Most actions and [reactions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/reaction.md) can be clearly identified within a larger context of [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) simultaneous [interaction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md). However, agents rarely bother to thoroughly describe interactions, partly for these practical reasons:

1. Agents, and many other complex _adaptive_ [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md), are closely related to [_regulation_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/regulate.md) _and_ [_repair_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/repair.md) __ [_systems_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) which [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) them to create [significant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) action _without_ deeply influencing their specific traits. (These regulating and repair systems may sometimes be distinguished as [subsystems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subsystem.md) or as external [_support_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) _systems_.)
2. Many interactions occur between elements of such vastly different [scales](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scale.md) that it seems practically impossible-- and unimportant-- to identify significant changes in most of the interacting elements. For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), it’s unimportant (to humans, so far) to identify the influence of an _accelerating_ automobile upon the _velocity_ of the Earth, which technically does have an “equal and opposite” _inertial_ reaction. Likewise, it’s unimportant to determine the _microscopic_ (tidal) influence of the moon’s gravity upon a puddle.

On a closely related note, many _abundant_ and _easily_ [_accessed_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md) resources, such as oxygen for respiration, are generally taken for granted ([assumed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assume.md) and ignored) by most if not all agents within specific contexts.
