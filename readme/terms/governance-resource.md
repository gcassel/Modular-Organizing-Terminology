# governance-resource

**Definition**

A _governance resource_ is a [model](model.md) which [_directly_](direct.md) __ [_supports_](support.md) _the_ [_governance_](govern.md) _of one or more_ [_resources_](resource.md).

**Notes**

Most governance resources are generated within diverse (and often inconsistent) [systems](system.md) and [formats](format.md). By contrast, [Modular Organizing Recipe](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ssWfsuaKQkytdW1q83qKzEjxrY-BoreREch46JOMQY/edit?usp=sharing) (MOR) and related documents recommend a [standardized](standard.md) system for [developing](develop.md) governance resources and [formally](form.md) relating them to each other via [resource description frameworks](resource-description-framework.md) within an [official](official.md) governance system. The primary types of governance resource in MOR are as follows: Issue, Goal, Proposal, Project, Role, Product (subtypes Good and Service), Plan (subtypes Policy, Task, Event) and Report.

Governance resources often _include or_ [_link_](link.md) models and [maps](map.md) of other valued resources, including [physical](physical.md) resources, and can also include or link [recordings](record.md). (See also [subject resource](subject-resource.md).) Governance resources are widely [developed](develop.md) and used in varied [formats](format.md), often by large [bureaucracies](bureaucracy.md) which are controlled by small groups of people. They can also be developed [modularly](../../terms/modular.md) by [p2p](p2p.md) teams in [distributive](distribute.md) [networks](network.md).
