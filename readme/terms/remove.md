#### Definition

*To remove* is *to take an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) out of a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)*.

#### Notes

*Remove* generally implies that the element is not [transmuted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmute.md) or [destroyed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/destroy.md) in the [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) of removal.  (However, this depends on whether removal is [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) from the perspective of the removed element or the form which it's being removed from.)
