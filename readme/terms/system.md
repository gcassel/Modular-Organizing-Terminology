# system

**Definition**

_A system_ is a [_network_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) _which_ [_performs_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) _a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_process_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) within specific [conditions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/condition.md). (In other words, a system is a web of [connections](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/connect.md) which turns [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) into [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md).)

**Notes**

Each system is a _network of processes_ which are sufficiently insulated from other forces to [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) [predictable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) [patterns](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/pattern.md). _**System**_** is an extremely** [**generic**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) **** [**concept**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) **which applies to all** [**organisms**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organism.md)**,** [**collectives**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) **and machines** as well as many other [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) and [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md). (In fact, most of these forms contain multiple [hierarchical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) [levels](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level.md) with _systems within systems_.) All [sciences](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/science.md) and [technical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technical.md) [practices](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/practice.md) have [developed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) systematically by [defining](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md), [describing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) and (sometimes) [designing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) systems, their [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) and (often, for massive systems) [frameworks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/framework.md).

Systems can be [_physical_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md)_,_ [_conceptual_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) _or_ [_social_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md). Systems can [emerge](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) or be [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) by [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).

Systems are [created](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) by [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) which [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md) and [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md), [creating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) _positive_ or _negative_ [_feedback_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/feedback.md), which _amplifies_ or _attenuates_ subsequent inputs.

[Robust](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/robust.md) systems have well-defined positive and negative feedback systems which create [sustainability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) and [security](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/secure.md) against [predictable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) and likely [risks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md). [Resilient](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resilient.md) systems are robust _and_ are [_complexly_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) __ [_adaptive_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/adaptive.md) to diverse inputs.

Some systems may be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) mainly by networks of [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md). For instance, a toaster is a system which has been created by networking physical components which match [modular](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/module.md) [specifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) for systemic [function(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).

Systems (including subsystems) frequently use inputs from and create outputs to other systems. Systems appear to exist “separately”, and create complexity, because [forces](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md) interact intermittently according to distance, timing, resistance and barriers. Systems are often separated by specific forms (or forces) of resistance, and by barriers (including selectively permeable membranes.) The processes which occur in (and link) each system can develop either through “natural emergence”, without known decisions by any agents, and they can also develop through effective design which creates or adds to practically functioning systems. Relationships between systems, due to related inputs and outputs, create varying intensities of interdependence between the resources and agents involved in the different systems, to whatever extent they depend upon related resources, regardless of how each system is or isn't [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md).
