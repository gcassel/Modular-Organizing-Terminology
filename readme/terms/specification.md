# specification

**Definition**

A specification is an [_official_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) __ [_description_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) _of a_ [_valid_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/valid.md) __ [_potential_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) __ [_element_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Notes**

Specifications are [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) to diverse design contexts, and may be created by any [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) for many reasons. Specifications are most often associated with [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) in [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md). However, specifications may include [responsibilities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/responsibility.md) and [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) in [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) contexts.

A specification must [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) one or more [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of the specified element. Specifications do _not_ try to (impossibly) identify or [define](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) _all potential_ [_traits_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of each [instance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of a specified element.

Specifications tend to focus upon [**required**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) traits of each instance, and agents often [intend](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) for a specification to [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a [_necessary_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) _and_ [_sufficient_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/suffice.md) __ [_set_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) _of requirements_.

Specifications also often identify [**recommended**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommend.md) traits. They can also indicate [_prohibited_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/prohibit.md) and unwanted traits.

Specifications may identify positively or negatively defined requirements and recommendations. For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a specification could indicate that a computer must use a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of power supply, and it may also indicate that that computer may _not_ contain specific (possibly rare or dangerous) chemical compounds.

**Common Types of Specification**

Many [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) are specifications, although they may rarely be [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) as such. In addition to the aforementioned basic specification types of _requirement_ and _recommendation_, here are some [concepts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) which [inherently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) are specifications:

[_criterion_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/criterion.md)_,_ [_format_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/format.md)_,_ [_guideline_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/guideline.md)_,_ [_law_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/law.md)_,_ [_parameter_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/parameter.md)_,_ [_plan_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md)_,_ [_protocol_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/protocol.md)_,_ [_qualification_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/qualification.md)_,_ [_recipe_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recipe.md)_,_ [_rule_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rule.md)

[_Standard_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard.md): [_Mutually_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mutual.md) __ [_useful_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) _specifications_ often become unofficial or official standards.
