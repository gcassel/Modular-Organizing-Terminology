**Definitions**

_To recommend_ is _to_ [_state_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md) _that a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_action_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) _or_ [_activity_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md), _or_ its absence, would be [preferred](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/prefer.md) in a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

_A recommendation_ is a statement that a specific action or activity, or the lack thereof, would be preferred in a specific context.

**Notes**

Recommendations often refer to others' [selections](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/select.md) from multiple [options](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/option.md); for example, selecting a specific [good](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/good.md) or [service](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/service.md).

Agents may create recommendations to [_support_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) __ [_creative_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) __ [_production_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/produce.md) or to [_govern_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md) __ [_conceived_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) __ [_risks_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md).

Recommendations of relationships between [_types_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) _of elements_ are often [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) as [_guidelines_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/guideline.md). By contrast, recommendations of relationships between [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific) __ [_instances_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) _of elements_ are often identified as _recommendations_. For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), recommendations of specific [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) for specific [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) can be [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) in [_collective_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) __ [_governance_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md).
