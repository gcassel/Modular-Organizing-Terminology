# agent

**Definitions**

_An agent_ is _an individual,_ [_group_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) _or_ [_identity_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identity.md) which _has the_ [_ability_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ability.md)_,_ [_capacity_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/capacity.md) _and_ [_opportunity_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/opportunity.md) to [_sustainably_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) _make_ [_decisions_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decide.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

_Agency_ is the ability, capacity and opportunity to sustainably make decisions within a specific context.

**Notes**

Agency is often [associated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/associate.md) only with humans, but can be extended to a wide variety of [actors](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) by specific [projects](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md) and [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md).

_An agent_ often [_directly_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) __ [_represents_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) _a_ [_person_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md), or a [group](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of persons, in a [communications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md) [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md). In fact, people rarely distinguish _self-representative_ agents from actual persons, especially in [live communications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/live-communication.md). However, some social contexts may [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) each person to [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) multiple identities with [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) different [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md). Also (and quite [significantly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md)), [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) in many social contexts.

Agency is [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) to [legal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/legal.md) [definitions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) of [_corporation_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/corporation.md). (This is a fact, not an endorsement.)

Agents can [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md), and roles are often directly identified with specific agents; however, _agents may_ [_decide_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decide.md) _whether or not to perform roles_, except in [coercive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coercion.md) systems.

_**Each agent's identity should be**_ [_**unique**_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) **within each** [_**official**_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) _****_ [_**formal**_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) _**context.**_

[Sustainability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) is an important [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of agency. For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), _sustainable_ [_systems_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) often [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) the ongoing [assignment](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assignment.md) of (sustainably [acting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md)) agents to [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) which [provide](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/provide.md) systemic [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).

Agency is a trait of (some, but not all) [_complex adaptive systems_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex-adaptive-system.md)-- including [persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) and [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md)-- because such systems have the ability to _sustain,_ [_regulate_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/regulate.md) _and_ [_repair_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/repair.md) their decision-making agency within contexts with _greatly_ [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) traits.

Agents may sometimes [_delegate_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/delegate.md) _their agency_ in specific contexts not only to other complexly adaptive agents, but also to [bots](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/bot.md) or to [_automated_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/automate.md) __ [_processes_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) which they've [personally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) [approved](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/approve.md).
