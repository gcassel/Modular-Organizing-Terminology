# output

**Definition**

An output is a [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) which (1) _is_ [_created_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) _or co-created by a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_process_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md), and (2) _can be_ [_accessed_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md) _independently of that process._

**Notes**

Outputs often _exit_ from [subsystems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subsystem.md) to be [_used_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) _as_ [_inputs_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) in a [base](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) system.

[Information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) can be easily [replicated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/replicate.md) and [transmitted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md) outside of a system without ever _exiting_ that system.
