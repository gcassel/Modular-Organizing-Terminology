# role

**Definition**

A role is a [_functional_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) __ [_relationship_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) which an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) has with an _agent or_ [_resource_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md).

**Notes**

Agents often [serve](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/serve.md) roles in [projects](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md) and [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md). (Projects and collectives are resources.)

Each role has one or more [_accountabilities_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accountability.md) _and_ [_authorizations_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authorize.md), although they often remain un[defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md). Many roles also are [exclusively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/exclude.md) [assigned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md), and have prerequisite [requirements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md).

[_Complex_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) _ongoing roles_ are often referred to as [posts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/post.md), positions or _occupations_. (Note that _position_ is defined much more [generically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) in MOT.)
