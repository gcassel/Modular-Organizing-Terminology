# immediate

**Definition**

_Immediate_ is a [_relational trait_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relational-trait.md) of [interaction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) in which _two or more_ [_related_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) __ [_actions_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) occur at _nearly the same_ [_point_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/position.md) _in_ [_time_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/time.md).

**Notes**

_Immediacy_ is not [strictly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) [possible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md), but it is nonetheless a [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) and [practical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/practice.md) [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) in [_describing_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) _or_ [_designing_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) potential [_sequences_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) _of actions_ which occur within relatively _small_ [_physical_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) __ [_locations_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/location.md) (with respect to total extent of [spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md)) _and_ either (1) occur [directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) or (2) are _rapidly mediated_ by a _highly conductive medium_

In [planning](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md), the trait of immediacy may sometimes [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) as a useful [requirement](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md).
