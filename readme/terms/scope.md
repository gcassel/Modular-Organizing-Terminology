# scope

**Definition**

Scope is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) which [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [_limits_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md) a [_possible_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) __ [_context_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) to a [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_active_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) _context_.

Scope can be [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) by [_assigning_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) __ [_parameters_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/parameter.md) to [_variable_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) __ [_elements_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)_._

**Notes**

Scope may be [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) as the the proportional [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) (or ratio) of the _magnitude of an_ [_element_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) to _the magnitude of a_ [_context_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/context.md) which it's considered within.

Importantly, scope often indicates the relative size of an [_active_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/active.md) _context_ to a [_potential_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/potential.md) _context_.

Perceptions of scope often depend upon [ordinal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/order.md) rather than [interval](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) comparison, and can be neither mathematical nor precise. Therefore, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/describe.md) scope vaguely and un[official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/official.md)ly as small, medium, large or massive.

Mathematically precise scope, when possible, is the _ratio_ of an interval to its [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md), or to _another_ specific interval _within_ that dimension.

**Example(s)**

* An [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) might [request](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/request.md) to [discuss](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/discuss.md) the [topic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/topic.md) of _un_[_paid_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/remunerate.md) __ [_work_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/work.md) within the [scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md) of a specific [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md).
