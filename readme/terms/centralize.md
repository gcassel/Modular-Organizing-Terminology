# centralize

**Definition**

_To centralize_ is _to_ [_design_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) _a_ [_system_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) so that it is [_hierarchically_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) __ [_based_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) on (and often [_governed_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) _by_) one or more [_parent_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/parent.md) __ [_collectives_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md).

**Notes**

_Centralized_ [_organization_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md) is [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) in many [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md). Centralized organization and governance is extremely common in [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) contexts including many [cultural](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/culture.md), [economic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/economy.md) and [political](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/politics.md) forms.

Systems may be [created](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) in a _centralized_ [_form_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md), or [modified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modify.md) to _become_ centralized.

The historic development of centralized organization reflects many historic [limitations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md) of [technology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technology.md). However, recent technological developments (including [telecommunications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/telecommunicate.md)) [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to _decentralize_ many historically centralized [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).
