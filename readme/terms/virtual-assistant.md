# virtual-assistant

**Definition**

A _virtual assistant_ (or VA) is _a_ [_software_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/software.md) __ [_program_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/program.md) _which is (1) not_ [_required_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), but which (2) _can_ [_help_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md) _a specific_ [_agent_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) one or more [_activities_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) within that context.

**Notes**

Virtual assistants can be distinguished from other software programs which _are_ [_required_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) by a specific role.

For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may need to use a specific software program to [communicate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communicate.md) with other agents in a specific [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md). However, that agent may use a virtual assistant to help them communicate more effectively and efficiently. (The virtual assistant may or may not [interact](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interact.md) directly with other, required programs.)

Some virtual assistants may be [able](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ability.md) to [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) as [bots](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/bot.md). VAs which are bots may act as [delegates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/delegate.md) for agents within some contexts.
