# transmit

_To transmit_ is to [_transport_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transport.md) _a_ [_signal_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md).

[Sources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/source.md) often [store](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) transmitted signals. Thus, transmission often causes [replication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/replicate.md) of stored signals at the [destination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/destination.md).

Importantly, the [_use_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) _of shared_ [_addresses_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/address.md) can [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md) _simultaneous_ [_transmission_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmission.md) of [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) to large [_groups_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) _of_ [_authorized_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authority.md) __ [_agents_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md). For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a signal can be [automatically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/automate.md) transmitted to all [_member agents_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/member-agent.md) of a [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md).
