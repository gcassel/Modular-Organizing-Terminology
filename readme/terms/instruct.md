# instruct

**Definition**

_To instruct_ is _to_ [_sufficiently_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/suffice.md) __ [_describe_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md) _a_ [_potential_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) __ [_action_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md).

**Notes**

_Instruct_ complements the other [_basic_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) __ [_indicative_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) _actions_ of [_state_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md) and [_ask_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ask.md).

_Instructions_ are often given to by [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to _other agents_. However, agents may [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) instructions for themselves to [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) in [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md). Agents may also _instruct_ [programmable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/program.md) [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md), including [computers](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/computer.md).

Useful instructions [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md) shared context. That context may often be [implied](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/imply.md) in specific instructions. However, instructions do often include specific [details](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/detail.md) about their intended context.
