# collective-decision

**Definition**

A _collective decision_ is a [_decision_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decide.md) _which_ [_emerges_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) _from a_ [_set_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) _of_ [_signals_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) _by different_ [_agents_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).

**Notes**

[Collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) often [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) _collective decisions_ to [_commit_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/commit.md) __ [_intentionally_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) _shared_ [_resources_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) to [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md), [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) and [plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md).

It's often _un_[_necessary_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) for [groups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of agents to make _collective decisions_, when their members could (instead) separately commit resources. However, many actions, goals and plans _require a_ [_significant_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) _(and possibly specific) amount of_ [_investment_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/invest.md) to even [_potentially_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) be completed, or to fully complete specific [objectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/objective.md) (such as [subgoals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/substructure.md)) and _bonus goals_. [Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often attempt to [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) group decisions when they're necessary, and they _also_ often try to create them to unnecessarily increase their personal influence within a broad [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Collective decisions are often [developed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) according to specific [recipes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recipe.md). These recipes often include [voting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/vote.md) by the [participants](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participant.md) in a [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md), or the [_member agents_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/member-agent.md) of a group agent.
