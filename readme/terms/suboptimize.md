# suboptimize

**Definition**

_To suboptimize_ is _to_ [_optimize_](optimize.md) _a_ [_component_](component.md) _instead of its_ [_system_](system.md).

**Notes**

_Suboptimization_ is a problem mainly in well-defined [hierarchical](hierarchy.md) systems where a component is clearly a [subsystem](subsystem.md) which [depends](require.md) upon a specific parent system. For [example](example.md), it's often a [social](social.md) problem in [collectives](collective.md) in which subsystems have [unfairly](fair.md) [exploited](exploit.md) collective [resources](resource.md) (including [decision-making](decide.md) [authority](authority.md)) which have been [intentionally](intend.md) [invested](invest.md) in them.
