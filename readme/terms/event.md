# event

**Definition**

_An event_ is _an_ [_action_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) _or_ [_activity_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) _during a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_period_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md).

**Notes**

_Event_ is a [fundamentally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) for [_designing_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) _and_ [_planning_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) _activities_, including [meetings](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/meet.md) and [_sequences_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) _of activities_ such as conferences and conventions. It's also fundamentally useful for [_reporting_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/report.md) _specific_ [_instances_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) _of action and activity_.

The period during which an event occurs is often defined directly as an interval of time, but it can also be indirectly [based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) on [prerequisite](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/prerequisite.md) actions. [**Examples:**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md) Event X starts on May 11 at 9am and ends on June 3 at 4pm. Event Y starts when L amount of preproduction [remuneration](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/remunerate.md) has been [generated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md), and ends when Action R has been completed.

In many or most cases, _non-chronologically defined events_ are located purely by their [position](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/position.md) in a [planned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) [sequential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md). For example, a [recipe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recipe.md) typically [describes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) _a linear sequence of cooking events_.
