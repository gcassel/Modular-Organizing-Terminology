# warning

**Definition**

A warning is a [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) which [_indicates_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) _a_ [_potential_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) __ [_relationship_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) between an [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) and a [_damaging_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md) action.

**Notes**

Warnings are often but not inevitably [coercive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coerce.md). Warnings are also often but not inevitably [threatening](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/threat.md). By contrast, the [intentions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) of warnings can be purely _helpful_ and [informative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md). For example: _if_ an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) performs Action A, _then_ Action B will probably occur-- regardless of whether or not the warning person performs Action B, or in fact has any agency which seems [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) to the [probability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/probability.md) of Action B.

Warnings often describe _potential_ [_protective_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/protect.md) _action_. Such protective action could [_restrict_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restrict.md) _others' potential actions_ without otherwise damaging them. However, protective use of force may also sometimes create _predictable and unavoidable_ [_risk(s)_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md) _of unintended damage_ to the [subjects](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subject.md) of restrictive force.
