*To base* is *to [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* by *[relating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) it to another specific element*.
		
*Basic* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) which [indicates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) that an element [provides](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/provide.md) a *[required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md)* at a *[simpler](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/simplicity.md) [level](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level.md)* of a *specific [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)*.
		
**Synonyms:**  *fundamental* is a synonym of *basic*
		
**Notes:** [Describing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) an element as basic to another form does *not* necessarily indicate any [perception](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) of the relative [complexity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md) of the [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) elements.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md), a regular monetary income may be fundamental to Jane's health within a specific formal [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md); however, creating and [sustaining](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) that income may seem anywhere from quite [simple](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/simple.md) to incomprehensively complex in different [instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of that [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md).
