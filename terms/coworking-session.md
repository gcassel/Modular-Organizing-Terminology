#### Definition
A *coworking session* is an [event](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md) or [session](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/session.md) in which two or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) simultaneously [work](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/work.md) on the same [project](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md) or [task](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/task.md), whether they are or aren't [meeting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/meet.md) for any or all of the session.

#### Notes
Coworking sessions are often defined by project or by a temporary and generalized project-related task, instead of a highly [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) shared focus.  Coworking sessions often oscillate between generalized coworking focus and highly specific shared focus, and between parallel working and live meeting.
