#### Definition

An identifier (or ID) is a *[resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) which, either alone or in combination with other identifiers, [sufficiently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/suffice.md) [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md)* a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) *[agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md), [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) or [event](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md)* within a *[formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)*.

#### Specialized Definition

A *[user](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) ID* or *[participant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) ID* is *an identifier which represents an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) in a [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) system.*

#### Notes

Identifiers are (or are part of) [identities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md), but identity is a much broader and more [flexible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/flexible.md) [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md).

Identifiers often represent *agents or [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* in social contexts, including [signaling](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) [networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md).

Each ID must be a *specific [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md)*.  Such information may be visual or verbal, but can be (and often is) represented as [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md).

Identifiers are often [names](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/name.md), but they may be any [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of information including *alphanumeric* or *binary* *[strings](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/string.md)*.
