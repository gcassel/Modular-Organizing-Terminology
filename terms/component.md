#### Definition

*A component* is *any [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) or [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* which *has both of the following [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md)*:

1. is a [persistent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persistent.md) [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) in a [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)
2. *can be [added](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/add.md) to or [removed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/remove.md) from that system*

#### Notes

Components are technically [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) in systemic [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md), but unlike *non-persistent* inputs, have one of the two following traits:

1. are apparently unaffected by the process, as with chemical catalysts
2. experience minor and predictable change, and can be reliably repaired or replaced by a related system  

Each component may be the sole provider of a specific input or function in a system, or may be a member of a [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of components which [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) the same functions.  (For example, each skin cell is a component in the skin of an animal.)  Likewise, each component may or may not be [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) by any entities or forces which govern the system (or systems!) which it functions within. (Governance is a subject in which mental and social organization is more akin to ecology than biology.  The organisms in an ecosystem influence each other deeply, but are rarely governed by each other; by contrast, biological cells and organs are always governed by a specific organism.)

In [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) systems, the function(s) provided by each component may be either required or recommended by designers or governers.

The relationships between components may [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) through direct [interfaces](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interface.md) or via [connectors](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/connect.md) (mediums, [links](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md) or [channels](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/channel.md)).  Connectors are also systemic components, and should be defined as such unless it’s practical to ignore them because they’re so generic or ubiquitous.  (For example, we often safely assume that air is present to transmit sound.)  If special connectors are identified, the components which they connect are [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) [nodes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/node.md).

#### Examples

1. An *eye* performs the function of providing vision for an organism.
2. A nerve (made of nerve cells) performs the function of sending electrical signals between organs in animals.  (Nerves create channels.)
3. A *motor* performs the function of providing power to move a vehicle.
4. A *paragraph* performs the function of developing a [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) component (or "point") in an essay.
5. A *[committee](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/committee.md)* performs one or more specific functions in a [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md).
6. A *[peer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/peer.md)* performs one or more specific functions in a [p2p](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/p2p.md) [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) system.
