#### Definition

*A component* is *any [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) or [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* which *has both of the following [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md)*:

1. *is a [persistent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persistent.md) [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) in a [model](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) or [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)*
2. *can be [added](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/add.md) to or [removed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/remove.md) from that model or system*

#### Notes

Components are technically [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) in systemic [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md), but unlike *non-persistent* inputs, components have one of the following traits:

1. are apparently unaffected by the process, as with chemical catalysts
2. experience minor and [predictable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) [change](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/change.md), and can be [dependably](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/depend.md) [repaired](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/repair.md) or [replaced](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/replace.md) by a [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) system  

Each component may be the sole provider of a specific input or function in a system, or may be a member of a [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of components which [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) the same functions.  (For example, each skin cell is a component in the skin of an animal.)  Likewise, each component may or may not be [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) by any [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) or [forces](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md) which govern the system (or systems!) which it functions within. (Governance is a subject in which [mental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mental.md) and [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organize.md) is more akin to ecology than biology.  The organisms in an [ecosystem](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ecosystem.md) [influence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/influence.md) each other deeply, but are rarely governed by each other; by contrast, biological cells and organs are always governed by a specific organism.)

In [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) systems, the function(s) provided by each component may be either [required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) or [recommended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommend.md) by designers or governers.

The relationships between components may [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) through direct [interfaces](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interface.md) or via [connectors](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/connect.md) ([mediums](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md), [links](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md) or [channels](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/channel.md)).  Connectors are also systemic components, and should be defined as such unless it’s practical to ignore them because they’re so [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/generic.md) or ubiquitous.  (For example, we often safely assume that air is present to transmit sound.)  If special connectors are identified, the components which they connect are [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) [nodes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/node.md).

#### Examples

1. An *eye* performs the function of providing vision for an organism.
2. A nerve (made of nerve cells) performs the function of sending electrical signals between organs in animals.  (Nerves create channels.)
3. A *motor* performs the function of providing power to move a vehicle.
4. A *paragraph* performs the function of developing a [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) component (or "point") in an essay.
5. A *[committee](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/committee.md)* performs one or more specific functions in a [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md).
6. A *[peer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/peer.md)* performs one or more specific functions in a [p2p](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/p2p.md) [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) system.
