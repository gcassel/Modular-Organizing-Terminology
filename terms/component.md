#### Definition

*A component* is *any [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) or [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* which *has both of the following [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md)*:

1. is a [persistent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persistent.md) [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) in a [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)
2. *can be [added](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/add.md) to or [removed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/remove.md) from that system*.

#### Notes

Components are often [nodes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/node.md); however, [paths](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/path.md) can often be [sufficiently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sufficient.md) [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) to function as (and, therefore, *be*) components.

A component may be the sole [provider](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/provide.md) of a [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) in a system, or may be a *[unit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unit.md) in a [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md)* of components which each perform the same function(s).

Likewise, a component *may or may not* be [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) by any [forces](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md) which govern any specific system which it functions within. This is a subject in which mental and social organization is much more akin to ecological organization than biological organization; a cell or organ is always governed by a specific organism, but the organisms in an ecosystem are rarely governed by each other.

In [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) systems, the function(s) provided by each component may be either required or recommended.

#### Examples

An *eye* performs the function of providing vision for an organism.

A *motor* performs the function of providing power to move a vehicle.

A *paragraph* performs the function of developing a [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) component (or "point") in an essay.

A *[committee](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/committee.md)* performs one or more specific functions in a [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md).

A *[peer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/peer.md)* performs one or more specific functions in a [p2p](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/p2p.md) [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) system.
