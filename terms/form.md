#### Definition

*To form* is *to [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* which *[groups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) other elements*. 

*A form* is an element which groups other elements.   

#### Notes

*Form* is a [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) in [Modular Organizing Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/).   **Forms include all [sets](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md), [networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md), [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) and [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md).**

Forms can group elements which are either [actual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) *or* [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Forms can [emerge](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emerge.md) un[intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md), with or without [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) by [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).   Forms can also be [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) by agents to [frame](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/frame.md) potential elements.  

Forms can *include* one or more specific *[groups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of elements*.  Forms which contain groups might *or* might not be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) as the *sum, or the product* of those specific groups.

**A specific *[instance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) or [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md)* of element can be [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) as an element *or* as a form**, depending on context and [scale](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scale.md) of [perception](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md)/ perspective such as specific *[hierarchical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) [level](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level.md)*.

A form must be [usefully](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) *[stable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/stabilize.md)* within one or more contexts.  However, those contexts may be identified *[physically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md), [conceptually](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) or [experientially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md)*.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), physical contexts have *[spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md) [scale](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scale.md)*, within which forms can be identified by *[potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [participant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* and/or *sensing* [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md).  

Physical forms can be [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) as *particles*, [intervals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md), [waves](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/wave.md) or [fields](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/field.md) at different levels of detail.  Instances of those types of form can variably be experienced as *fluid* or *solid* at different scales of [organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organize.md).  

Fluid forms often last briefly.  For example, an identifiably shaped gust (four dimensional waveform) of wind could last a few seconds.  However, fluid forms also can [endure](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/endure.md) indefinitely if sustained by [repeated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/repeat.md) [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) of energy.  For example, a stretch of rapids on a river, or an oceanic whirlpool, could last for decades or centuries.  

Solid forms can also last briefly.  For example, a snowflake could melt a few seconds after landing on a warm surface.  However, solid forms can last long periods in the absence of intensely or persistently creative/destructive energy.  For example, a mountain could endure (while slowly eroding) for millions of years.   

Conceptual forms often can have analogies to physical *solidity* and *fluidity*.

**Forms often *[function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md)* as elements** in large-[scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md) models (or [overviews](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/overview.md)) with low levels of detail.  For instance, snowflakes and mountains often function as conceptual elements, despite being clearly identifiable as ([complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md)) forms.

#### Synonyms

*build*, *construct*, *structure*

#### [Specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) Definitions  

*Structure* often especially means *the [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*.

Within that [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), *a structure* is a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) network of physical elements*.

*A building* often especially means *a non-[portable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/portable.md) network of physical elements.*   

Structure also often [implies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/imply.md) *[designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) structure* in some [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md). However, it's also used broadly to [indicate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) [emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) structures.
