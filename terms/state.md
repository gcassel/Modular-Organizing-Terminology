#### Definitions

*To state* is *to [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) a [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md)*.

*A statement* is *a representation of a concept*.
		
#### Notes

*State* is the [base](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of *[indicate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md), [ask](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ask.md) and [instruct](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instruct.md)*.

*Statements* may include representations of [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) certainty *or* of any perceived [probabilities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/probability.md).  In many [languages](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md) including English, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) are [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) familiar with statements which are strongly *declarative* (and don't indicate any perception of probability or uncertainty). 
		
[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often *state* [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md), [mental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mental.md) *and/or* [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [perceptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) and [concepts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md).
		
[Useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) statements [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md) shared context.  Such context may often be [implied](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/imply.md) in specific statements.   However, statements often do include [details](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/detail.md) about their [intended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) context.
