Simplicity is a [dimensional variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/dimensional-variable.md) which is the *inverse of [complexity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md)*.   Thus, a *simple [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* seems to contain few or no internal *[interactions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interactive.md) [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md). 

Like complexity, simplicity may be considered a [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md).  

See also the more [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) term *[simple form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/simple-form.md)*.
