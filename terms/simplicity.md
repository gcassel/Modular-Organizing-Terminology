#### Definition

*Simplicity* is a [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) which is the *inverse of [complexity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md)*.   

*Simple* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which have high simplicity within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

Most elements are [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md); however, a perfectly simple element isn't a form at all.  (It could however be part of one or more forms.)
