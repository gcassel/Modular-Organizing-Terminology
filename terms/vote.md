*To vote* is *to [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) an [agent's](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [selection(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/select.md)* among a *[set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of [options](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/option.md)* in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
		
**[Specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [Meaning](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mean.md):**  *Voting* is especially associated with contexts in which *specific agents* are assigned to specific [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) in a [group agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md).   (However, the [definition](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/definition.md) of voting here is flexibly [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) for other contexts, including [consent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/consent.md)-based "formal consensus" *[decision](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decision.md) [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)*.)
