#### Definitions

*To emerge* is *to be [created](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) by [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) between [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*.

*Emergent* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of all [relational traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relational-trait.md).

#### Notes

*Emergence* is deeply distinguished from *[design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md)* in Modular Organizing Terminology. (Designed relationships are *[mediated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) by designed elements*, instead of emerging directly from relationships.)
