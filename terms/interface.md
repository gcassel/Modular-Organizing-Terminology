#### Definition

*An interface* is an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) or [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) which *[links](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md) two or more [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* by *[creating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md)* between them.

#### Specialized Definitions

The term interface is [generally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) in [modeling](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md), although it's often [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [associated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/associate.md) with [software](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/software.md) [development](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md).  Interfaces turn [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) relationships into [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) relationships in specific [conditions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/condition.md), [creating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) systems.  The elements which are [linked](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md) by interfaces become [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) in the activated system.

[Designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) interfaces, like those in the aforementioned software development, often [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to [control](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/control.md) (and [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md)) [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md).
