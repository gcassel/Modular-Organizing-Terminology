#### Definitions

*To endure* is *to remain [present](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/presence.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) throughout a specific [period](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md)*.

*Duration* is *the [period](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md) which a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) endures* within a specific context.

*Durability* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) which [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) the *[relative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) [predicted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) duration* of a specific element as compared to [alternatives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/alternative.md).

*During* is a preposition which limits the [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) of a [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) to a specific [interval](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) of time.

#### Notes

*Endure* and *[persist](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md)* are practically equivalent (and, don't need separate formal definitions), but *durable* and *persistent* are not equivalent.  (*Persistent* is a [strictly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of *durable*.)

The context within which an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) endures *may have widely [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) temporal limits*.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), an ocean may endure indefinitely on a specific planet, depending on climate-- but it would not survive the planet's [destruction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/destroy.md).  Likewise, elements may endure indefinitely during very *brief* but *contextually [crucial](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/crucial.md)* [intervals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md).

#### Related Terms

* *permanence*:  [Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) *permanence* in [ways](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) which are [practically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/practice.md) synonymous with *durable* or *persistent*.  However, *permanence* has also often been used for (non-logical) [claims](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/claim.md) about [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) supposedly lasting forever, or existing outside of the *[spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md) continuum*.
