Organization is the *[emergence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) and/or [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md)* of [form(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md). 

**Notes:**  The term *organization* frequently refers to *either* the *[active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) presence* or the *[intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md)* of forms.  Additionally, organization often refers to either *[types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md)* or *[instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md)* of forms.  Therefore, this term is only very [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) in clearly [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
