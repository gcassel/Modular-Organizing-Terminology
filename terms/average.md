*To average* is *to reduce a [quantitative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/quantity.md) [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md)* to an *[element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) that set*.
		
**Notes:**  Many *averaging [formulae](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/formula.md)* are [possible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md).  However, averaging [tends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tend.md) to be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) with the arithmetic *mean, median and mode*.   
		
Averaging can [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) many [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [searching](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/search.md), [sorting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sort.md) and [filtering](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/filter.md) [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) for a [database](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/database.md).

All averaging formulae are *abstractly reductive*.  They *[eliminate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/eliminate.md) [significant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md)* from a [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) set.  
		
Instead of averaging, it's often possible (but challenging) to [map](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/map.md) sets of quantities in ways which *do not eliminate information* and are *highly [legible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/legible.md)*.
