Capacity is the [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) to *[use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) an [ability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ability.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), such as a specific [interval](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) of *time*. 

The context in which capacity is present is stricter and smaller in [scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md) than the context in which ability is present.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), John may be able to drive from his house to the store, but may lack the capacity to do that on Wednesday.
