*To map* is *to [model](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)* in a way which *[represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/representation.md) the [distribution](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* in one or more [dimensions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md).

**Notes:**  This is a [strict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) [technical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technical.md) [definition](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/definition.md) which [fundamentally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) distinguishes *a map* as a *[specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [model](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md)*.  That distinction will especially [benefit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/benefit.md) from the [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) of [examples](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md).

*Mapping* is especially associated with maps which represent *[physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) distribution*.  However, it can be used to represent distribution in any types of dimensions.
