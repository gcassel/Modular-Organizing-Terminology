#### Definition

*To map* is *to [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) the [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) [distribution](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) of one or more [variables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md)* in a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [model](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md)* at a specific time, or during a [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) [stage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/stage.md).

*A map* is a model which represents the perceived distribution and/or [status](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/status.md) of one or more of its (variable) [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) during a temporal context: i.e., at a specific time, or during a defined stage.

#### Notes

Maps often try to represent the status of most or all of their (variable) components at the point or within the stage which they represent, but they may focus on one or a few variables.  

Maps are helpful for acting, discussing, designing and deciding at a high level of detail.  We often model and map detailed structures in major long-term projects, such as organizational departments, roles and current role-holders.  Maps can be used as reports within sufficiently-defined contexts, and are often described or linked within large reports.  Maps sometimes use recordings either as primary data sources or supplementary overlays; for example, maps of Earth sometimes include satellite photographs.  The photographs per se aren’t maps, but they’re packaged and presented (by agents) as a map, or as part of one. 

*Mapping* is especially associated with maps which represent *[physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) distribution of [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md), [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) and [communities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md)*.  However, it can be used to represent distribution of any variables any defined [dimensions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/).

#### Example(s)

1. An MRI scan is a map of the current status of (part of) an organism, such as a specific eye.  (Eyes can also be generically modeled.)
2. A representation of magma flows and/or seismic activity is a map (and may be based on, or use, recordings.)
3. A geographic map could represent the state of Earth on June 13, 2023, or in 2023, or during the Middle Ages, or during the Cretaceous Period; etcetera.
4. A road map represents the current layout (and, sometimes, status) of roadways, on top of a regional map.
5. A [ledger](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ledger.md) is a map which represents highly detailed histories of actions, such as (but not limited to) financial transactions.
