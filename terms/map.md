#### Definition

*To map* is *to [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) the [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) [distribution](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) of one or more [variables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md)* in a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [model](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md)* at a specific time, or during a specific [period](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md).

*A map* is a model which represents the perceived distribution and/or [status](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/status.md), at a specific time (or during a specific period), of one or more variable [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md).

#### Notes

This is a [strict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) [technical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technical.md) [definition](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/definition.md) which [fundamentally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) distinguishes *a map* as a *[specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [model](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md)*.  That distinction will especially [benefit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/benefit.md) from the [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) of [examples](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md).

*Mapping* is especially associated with maps which represent *[physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) distribution of [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md), [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) and [communities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md)*.  However, it can be used to represent distribution of any variables any defined [dimensions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/).
