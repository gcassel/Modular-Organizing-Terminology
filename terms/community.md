#### Definition

A community is a *[network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* who are all *[motivated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/motivate.md) to [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)*.  
 
#### Notes

*Community* is an extremely [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) and [flexible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/flexible.md) [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) here.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), this [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) may refer to diverse and overlapping networks which are related through [diverse](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/diverse.md) resources.  **Communities vary immensely in the [intensity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intensity.md) and [frequency](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/frequency.md) of their [interactions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md).**  However, each community can be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) by the use of a specific resource.

**Communities aren't [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md)**, although they can contain or [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to any number of collectives.  Collectives often seek to [serve](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/serve.md) one or more specific communities, with widely varying degrees of [success](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/succeed.md).
