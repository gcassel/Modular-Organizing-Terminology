A community is a *[network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* who all *share a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md)* with a specific [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md).  
 
**Notes:**  *Community* is an [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) extremely [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) here.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), this [description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) may refer to diverse and overlapping networks which are related through diverse resources.  However, each community can be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) according to a specific relationship with one or more *[instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) or [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md)* of resource.
