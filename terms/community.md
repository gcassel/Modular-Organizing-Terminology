#### Definition

A community is a *[network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* who all *[use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)*.  
 
#### Notes

*Community* is an [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) and [flexible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/flexible.md) [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) here.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), this [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) may refer to diverse and overlapping networks which are related through [diverse](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/diverse.md) resources.  However, each community can be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) by the use of a specific resource.

**Communities aren't [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md)**, although they can contain or [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to any number of collectives.  Collectives often seek to [serve](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/serve.md) one or more specific communities, with widely varying degrees of [success](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/succeed.md).
