#### Definition

Significance is a [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) which [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) the [conceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) *[presence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/presence.md) or [absence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/absence.md)* of *[requirement](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md), or [intensity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intensity.md) of [recommendation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommend.md)*, of a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [indication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md)* (or [statement](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md)) in a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md). 

#### Notes
This definition is trickily technical, and needs work and/or extended explanation.  Placeholder examples:

1. A statement is very significant if it is *required* within a strict social context.
2. A statement is significant if it is *intensely recommended* within a social context.
