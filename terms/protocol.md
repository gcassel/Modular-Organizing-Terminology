#### Definition

A *protocol* is a *[plan](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) to [coordinate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordinate.md) one or more [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Specialized Definition

*Protocol* often [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) means *a standard [procedure](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequential-process.md)* for *[performing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) a [sequential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) [signaling](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)*, such a repeated exchange of signals of [predictable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md).

#### Notes

Protocols are often part of [policies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/policy.md).  Each protocol can be [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) as a *[guideline](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/guideline.md) or a [rule](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rule.md)* in [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), such as [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) and [communities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md).  (Each protocol can, additionally, contain any combination of guidelines and rules.)

Protocols [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md) [effective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md) and [efficient](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/efficient.md) [communications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communicate.md) in diverse [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  Some are [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) for [live communication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/live-communication.md) or [telecommunication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/telecommunicate.md), including [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) protocols such as *http*.

A digital protocol may consist entirely of a standardized [format](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/format.md) for a *[type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of signal* in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  However, protocols often standardize [sequential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) and [programs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/program.md) which [exchange](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/exchange.md) specific types of signals.
