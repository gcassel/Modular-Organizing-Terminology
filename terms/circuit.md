#### Definition

A *circuit* is *a sub[system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) which enables a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)*.

#### Note
Circuits are [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) directly in relation to specific [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) and [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md).  

Circuits are rarely defined except within [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) systems which are [strictly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md).
