#### Definition

A pattern is a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) which occurs *more than once* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

Patterns may occur and recur within one [hierarchical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) [levels](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level.md) within a context, [based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) upon how [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) and [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) are *[perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md), [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md)* and (sometimes) *[factored](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/factor.md)*.  Patterns may also recur through *multiple* hierarchical levels.
