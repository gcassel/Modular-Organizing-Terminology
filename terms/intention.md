*Intentional actions* are actions by agents who seem to be *consciously [motivated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/motivation.md)* by one or more specific intentions. 
 
Note: conscious motivations aren’t necessarily the only, or main, motivations for specific actions.
