#### Definition

*To complicate* is to make a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) *more [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md)*-- and more *[potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) confusing*-- by *[developing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) one or more [sequential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) within it*.

#### Notes

*Complicated forms* contain one or more complicated [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md), regardless of whether those processes are [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) or [emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md).

*Complication* is [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) associated with *sequential processes* which may include *[significant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) and unpredictable delays*.

*Complication* is also especially associated with *[hierarchically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) [organized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md) [groups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)*, because hierarchical groups often *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) [rules](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rule.md)* which [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md) sequential processes.

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often *conflate* the meaning of the [terms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) *[complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md)* and *complicated*.  [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/) [recommends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommend.md) a clear and [flexibly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/flexible.md) [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) distinction between them.
