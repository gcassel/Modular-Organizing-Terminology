#### Definition

A field is a *[region](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/region.md) in which a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [force](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md) [acts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md)*.

#### Notes

Fields often (but not always) contain only *contiguous* [positions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/position.md).

Fields may be [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) by any [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) which can [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) a set of locations, including *mathematical [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md)*.  Many [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) fields are defined according to three-dimensional *space* or four-dimensional [spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md).
