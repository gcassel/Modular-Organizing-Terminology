#### Definition

A field is a *[region](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/region.md) in which a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [force](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md) can [act](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md)*.

#### Notes
Fields are often [associated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/associate.md) primarily with [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) fields and not [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) fields.  For example, in physics, fields of active electromagnetic (or other) force are deeply important. However, potential fields can be very [socially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) important in [developing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) *[governable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) [channels](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/channel.md)*; therefore, fields are [generically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) here with potentiality, instead of [strictly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) identifying them with active force.  Within the [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) of [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [MOT](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/) [ontology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ontology.md), fields can be [composably](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compose.md) identified when [needed] as "active fields" or "electromagnetic fields", etcetera.

Fields often (but not always) contain only *contiguous* [positions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/position.md).

Fields may be [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) by any [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) which can [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) a set of locations, including *mathematical [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md)*.  Many [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) fields are defined according to three-dimensional *space* or four-dimensional [spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md).
