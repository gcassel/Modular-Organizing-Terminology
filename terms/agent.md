#### Definition

*An agent* is an *[identity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identity.md) which has [agency](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agency.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)*.   

#### Notes  

*An agent* often *[directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) a [person](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md)*, or a [group](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of persons, in a [communications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md) [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).  In fact, people rarely distinguish *self-representative* agents from actual persons, especially in [live communications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/live-communication.md).   However, some social contexts may [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) each person to [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) multiple identities with [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) different [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md). Also (and quite [significantly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md)), [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) in many social contexts.

Agency is [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) to [legal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/legal.md) [definitions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) of *[corporation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/corporation.md)*.  (This is a fact, not an endorsement.)

***Each agent's identity should be [unique](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md)* within each *[official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) context.***
