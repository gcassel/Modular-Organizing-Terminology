#### Definition

*An agent* is an individual, [group](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) or [identity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identity.md) which *has the [ability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ability.md), [capacity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/capacity.md) and [opportunity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/opportunity.md)* to *[sustainably](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) make [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) [decisions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decide.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes  

Agency is often [associated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/associate.md) only with humans, but can be extended to a wide variety of [actors](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) by specific [projects](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md) and [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md).  

*An agent* often *[directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) a [person](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md)*, or a [group](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of persons, in a [communications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md) [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).  In fact, people rarely distinguish *self-representative* agents from actual persons, especially in [live communications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/live-communication.md).   However, some social contexts may [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) each person to [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) multiple identities with [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) different [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md). Also (and quite [significantly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md)), [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) in many social contexts.

Agency is [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) to [legal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/legal.md) [definitions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) of *[corporation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/corporation.md)*.  (This is a fact, not an endorsement.)

Agents can [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md), and roles are often directly identified with specific agents; however, *agents may [decide](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decide.md) whether or not to perform roles*, except in [coercive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coercion.md) systems.

***Each agent's identity should be [unique](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md)* within each *[official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) context.***  

[Sustainability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) is an important [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of agency. For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), *sustainable [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)* often [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) the ongoing [assignment](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assignment.md) of (sustainably [acting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md)) agents to [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) which [provide](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/provide.md) systemic [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).

Agency is a trait of (some, but not all) *[complex adaptive systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex-adaptive-system.md)*-- including [persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) and [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md)-- because such systems have the ability to *sustain, [regulate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/regulate.md) and [repair](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/repair.md)* their decision-making agency within contexts with *greatly* [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) traits.

Agents may sometimes *[delegate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/delegate.md) their agency* in specific contexts not only to other complexly adaptive agents, but also to [bots](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/bot.md) or to *[automated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/automate.md) [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)* which they've [personally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) [approved](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/approve.md).
