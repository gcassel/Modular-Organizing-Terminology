#### Definitions

*A signature* is an *[instance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of an [agent's](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [identity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identity.md) within a [specified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)*, such as a [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) *entry* *field*, which *[signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) that agent's [intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intentional.md) [participation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) in a specified [agreement](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agree.md)*.

*A signatory* is *an agent who has signed a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) agreement.*

#### Notes

Some agreements may require *handwritten signatures*, or signatures which are created by *[secure](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/secure.md) [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) identities* using *encryption-based secure signaling*.
