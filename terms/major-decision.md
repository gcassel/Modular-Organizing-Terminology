#### Definition

A *Major Decision* is a decision which has a *gross collective cost* which exceeds the *greater* of the following numbers:  

1. The Standard Decision Threshold defined by a clearly relevant [post](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/post.md).
2. The Standard Decision Threshold for a clearly relevant [Project](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md) which you're a [Member](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/member.md) of.
3. The General Standard Decision Threshold as defined by the collective Stewards for unspecified expenditures.


#### Examples

If the General Major Decision Threshold is $200 but you have a post which allows you to spend up $400 for a clearly defined purpose, then spending $360 within the Scope of that Position is a [Standard Decision](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard-decision.md).

If the General Major Decision Threshold is $200 but your Project has a Major Project Decision Threshold of $500, then spending $300 would be a Standard Decision.

If the General Major Decision Threshold is $200 but your Project has a Major Project Decision Threshold of $500, then spending $510 would be a Major Decision.

#### Notes

Major Decisions require the permission of the Collective Stewards.
