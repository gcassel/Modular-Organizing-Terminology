#### Definition

A subsystem is a [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) which *is [regulated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/regulate.md) by another [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) system*.

#### Notes

A subsystem might or might not be able to exist [autonomously](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/autonomy.md) from the system or systems which regulate it.
