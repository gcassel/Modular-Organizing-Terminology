#### Definition

*A principle* is *an [assumption](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assume.md) or [belief](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/believe.md) about how to [effectively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md) [act](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), either to [support](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) a specific [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) or universally.
		
#### Notes 
		
Principles are often based upon other principles.  Those principles are sometimes based on yet other principles, but can also be [intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) or unintentional assumptions or [premises](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/premise.md).

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often *[base](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) the [development](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md)* of *[specifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md), [standards](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard.md), [agreements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agree.md)*, and many other [organizational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) on principles.  Therefore, agents may find it [efficient](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/efficient.md) to *[directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) [discuss](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dialogue.md) principles* before [collaborating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaborate.md) on specific [designs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md).
