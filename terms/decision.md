A decision is an [act](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) of *[committing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/commit.md) the [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md)* of one or more [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) to [support](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) action, [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) or [plan](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md).  

**Notes:**  

While [persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) often seem to *[react](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/reaction.md) unconsciously* to [experience](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md), they also often make conscious decisions to commit resources to specific actions in the near future.  We also frequently decide to commit resources to [sustain](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) goals or plans over the medium to long-term future.  Such goals and plans differ greatly in their [adaptability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/adapt.md) to [changing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/change.md) experience.
