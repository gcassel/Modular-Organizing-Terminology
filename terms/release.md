#### Definition

A *release*, or *release [edition](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/edition.md)*, is a *[product](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/product.md)* which *has been released for [unregulated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/regulate.md) use* in its [naming](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/name.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

If a release is a [protocol](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/protocol.md), a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) might expect all [participants](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) to use it in one or more specific [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md).

Products with extensive [developmental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) history often have a [sequence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) of releases which use strict numerical naming systems.
