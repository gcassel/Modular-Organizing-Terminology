#### Definition

*Live communication* is [communication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communicate.md) in which *[signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) are [transmitted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md) [immediately](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/immediate.md)* from at least one *[sending](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/send.md) [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* to at least one *[receiving](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/receive.md) agent*.
		
#### Notes

Both *[direct](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) "in person" communications* and *[telecommunications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/telecommunicate.md)* may be *live*.

In many or most live communications [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) are [mutually](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mutual.md) [able](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ability.md) to immediately [send](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/send.md) *and* [receive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/receive.md) signals to each other.  However, many tools and techniques enable agents to send live signals to receivers who aren't [enabled](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) to [directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) *respond*.   (For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), that's often the case with news broadcasts.)
