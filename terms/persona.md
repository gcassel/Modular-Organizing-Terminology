#### Definition

*A persona* is *a [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) of [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md)* which *is [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md)* and *[produces](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/produce.md) [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [behavior](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/behave.md)* within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Alternate Definition

A persona is a [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) [identity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identity.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specify.md) [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

A persona can be considered *an active personality*.  It can occur through [intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) "acting" (which is [simulation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/simulate.md)) or be purely unintentional.  

In [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) contexts, *profile* and *account* are sometimes used as synonyms for *persona*, but this [imprecisely](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/precise.md) [conflates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/conflate.md) other [technically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technique.md) [uses](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) of those two terms, such as [defining](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) [digital accounts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/account.md) and distinguishing them from personae.
