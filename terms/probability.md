Probability is the [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) of *[conceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) frequency* that a [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) *will be [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

(Extended Tangential) **Notes:** probability may [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/representation.md) variability which seems practically [arbitrary](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/arbitrary.md) *or* highly predictable on any specific [level of detail](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/level-of-detail.md).  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), the probability of a getting a result of "1" on a six-sided die roll is almost exactly 1/6 or 16.7%, *and* that variability seems practically arbitrary.   By contrast, the probability of an arbitrarily selected student getting an "A" on a test may be roughly 1/4 or 25%, *and* that variability may seem to be directly [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) to very predictable specific [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md).
