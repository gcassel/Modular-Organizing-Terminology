*Probability* is *[potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/potential.md) which can be  [measured](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/measure.md)* on a [scale](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/scale.md) from 0 to 1 (or 0% to 100%) [absence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/absence.md) to [presence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/presence.md). 

(extended tangential draft) **Notes:**  Probability may [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/representation.md) variability which seems practically [arbitrary](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/arbitrary.md) *or* highly predictable on any [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/specific.md) [level of detail](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/level-of-detail.md). For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), the probability of a getting a result of "1" on a six-sided die roll is almost exactly 1/6 or 16.7%, *and* that variability seems practically arbitrary. By contrast, the probability of an arbitrarily selected student getting an "A" on a specific test may be roughly 1/4 or 25%, *and* that variability may seem to be consistently [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) to specific [factors](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/factor.md) such as [requirements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/require.md).
