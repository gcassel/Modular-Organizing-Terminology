#### Definition

*Science* is *[systematic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) [theorizing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/theorize.md)* which is [based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) on *[experience](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md), [research](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/research.md) and [controlled](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/control.md) [experimentation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experiment.md)*.

#### Notes

It's quite difficult to [effectively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md) control experiments which are [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) or unintentionally based on extremely [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [concepts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md).  This applies to complex [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) concepts, but [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) to [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) concepts, because they're often based on questionable [assumptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assume.md) about physical experience.

Theory which *can't be [falsified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/contradict.md)* is *[inherently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inherent.md) unscientific*.
