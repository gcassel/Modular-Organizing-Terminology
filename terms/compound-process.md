#### Definition

A *compound process* is a [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) which *[emerges](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) from [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md)* in a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md)* of *two or more processes*.

#### Notes

In [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), *compound processes* may be [modeled](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) based on *[perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) [requirement](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md)* of the *[component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) processes* to the compound process.  [Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may additionally [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) *non-required* processes which *[provide](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/provide.md) [optional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/option.md) [recommended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommend.md) functions* within a compound process.

Compound processes may often [link](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md) various [hierarchies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md), [parallel](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/parallel.md) processes and [sequential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) processes.
