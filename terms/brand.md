#### Definition

*To brand* is *to [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/develop.md) a [unique](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/unique.md) [identity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/identify.md)* for a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/specific.md) [provider](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/provide.md) of [products](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/product.md)*.

*A brand* is *an identity which [sufficiently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/suffice.md) identifies a provider of products* within one or more [markets](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/market.md).

#### Notes

One or more of a brand's traits, or a [compound](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/compound.md) of those traits, must [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/create.md) a sufficiently distinctive identity within a specific [market](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/market.md). Other traits support or further develop that identity.
