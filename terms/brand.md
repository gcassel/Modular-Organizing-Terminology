#### Notes

One or more of a brand's traits, or a [compound](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/compound.md) of those traits, must [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/create.md) a unique identity within a specific [market](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/market.md). Other traits support or further develop that identity.
