#### Definition

A limit is a [position](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/position.md), [interval](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md), wave or field which identifies either the (1) *[designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) or [inherent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) [parameter](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/parameter.md)* or (2) *[conceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) terminus of an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*.

#### Notes

For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), designed limits are often applied to [dimensions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) to limit the [scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md) of an [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  *Some* dimensions also have [inherent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) limits; for example, the natural limits of [probability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/probability.md) are 0% and 100% (or a dimension of 0 to 1 *presence*.)
