#### Definition

*To delegate* is to *[provisionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/provisional.md) [transfer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transfer.md) [authority](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authority.md)* within *a [specified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) [scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md) of [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md)*.  

*A delegate* is *an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) who currently has [custody](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/custody.md) of another agent's provisionally transferred authority.* 

#### Notes

*Delegation* is often an *[intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [temporary](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/temporary.md) [event](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md)*.

[Collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) often *delegate [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) and [instructions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instruct.md) to [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [member-agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/member-agent.md)* of the collective, or even to non-member [participants](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md).  

[Accountable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accountability.md) delegation requires [strict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) [maintenance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/maintain.md) of [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) [security](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/secure.md) and [privacy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/private.md) [standards](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard.md).  For example, agents may not share authorized [access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md) to private data with unauthorized agents simply for the sake of delegating [tasks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/task.md).  (This is because data-sharing is practically irreversible, because shared data can be remembered and/or exported from private [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).)  (On the other hand, agents with authorized access may sometimes share that authority, but such [permission](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/permit.md) should be explicitly indicated and never assumed.)
