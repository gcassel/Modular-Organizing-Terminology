#### Definitions

*To require* is *to need the [presence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/presence.md) of a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* to *[sustainably](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) [support](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) a specific [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)*.

*A requirement* is an element which *must be [actively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) present* in a form-- [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) including [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) or [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)-- in a specific [official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  

#### Notes

Requirements are often especially [associated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/associate.md) with [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md).

Requirements for [participant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participant.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) in [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) contexts are often *mutually dependent* with [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md) and/or [responsibilities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/responsibility.md).

#### Synonyms

* *need* is a synonym of *require*
* *depend* is a *complement* to *require*.  (i.e. a *dependent* element *requires* another specific element)
