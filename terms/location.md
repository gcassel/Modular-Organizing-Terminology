#### Definition

A *location* is either *(1) an [element's](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) [position](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/position.md) or (2) the [interval(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) it occupies within one or more [dimension(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md)*.

#### Notes

This [description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) is especially abstract for technical reasons.  More examples may help. 

Location is predominantly associated with [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/physical.md) dimensions, but it may be either [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/form.md) *or* [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/concept.md).

Location(s) may be *strictly* [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) or [specified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) in some [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).  However, **locations can contain  [interval(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) of any size**, within any number of [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) dimensions.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a huge three-dimensional *area* of physical *space* (or four-dimensional [spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/spacetime.md)) can be identified with the location of the planet Earth.
