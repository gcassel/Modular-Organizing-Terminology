#### Definition

*A project* is *a [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) which one or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [supports](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md)* to *[serve](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/serve.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [mission](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mission.md)*.

#### Notes

Projects are often [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) by the intention to *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a specific [product](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/produce.md)*. 

A project is a system, but the relationships of [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) are often [vaguely](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/vague.md) [understood](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/understand.md) or [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md).  Also, not all supporters of "the project" [necessarily](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) support the addition of components to that system.  (This is a common source of misunderstanding, [confusion](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/confuse.md), [stress](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/stress.md) and [conflict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/conflict.md).)
