#### Definition

*A project* is *any [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) with a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [mission](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mission.md)*.

#### Notes

This intentionally expansive definition includes all organizations, [companies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/company.md) and [corporations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/corporation.md). It includes solitary as well as [collaborative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaborate.md) projects, and all subprojects at all [levels of design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level-of-design.md).
 Projects are often [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) by the intention to *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a specific [product](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/produce.md)*.  Projects often require significant research and development.  

Projects are [created](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) by [persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md), and are usually [officially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [supported](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) by one or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  (An unsupported project is often forgotten.)  Projects may be [sovereignly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sovereign.md) [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) or governed by other people or projects.  (Projects which are governed by other projects are [subprojects](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subproject.md)).

Each project has an [identifiable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) mission, but that mission can (with due permission) be changed, and can lead to unexpected results.  A project is a system, but the relationships between its [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) are often [vaguely](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/vague.md) [understood](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/understand.md) or [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md).  The relationships can also be very in[consistent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/consistent.md), [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) in in[formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) and un[official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) projects.  The system which [determines](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/determine.md) a project can be relatively simple or informal, such as an unordered list of [implicitly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/imply.md) supported [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md); it can also be extremely elaborate and formalized, as with massive production systems and companies.  Additionally, note that the [supporters](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) of "the project" don't [necessarily](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) support the addition of components to that system.  (This is a common source of misunderstanding, [confusion](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/confuse.md), [stress](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/stress.md) and [conflict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/conflict.md).)

Many projects are [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) which are often defined by constitutional [policies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/policy.md), and support many other policies.
