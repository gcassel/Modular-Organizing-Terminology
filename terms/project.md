#### Definition

*A project* is *a [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) with a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [mission](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mission.md)*.

#### Notes

The system of a project can be relatively simple or informal, such as an unordered list of implicitly supported activities; it can also be extremely elaborate and formalized, as with massive production systems and companies.

Projects are often [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) by the intention to *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a specific [product](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/produce.md)*. 

Projects are [created](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) by [persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md), and are usually [officially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [supported](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) by one or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  (An unsupported project is often forgotten.)  

A project is a system, but the relationships of [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) are often [vaguely](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/vague.md) [understood](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/understand.md) or [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md).  Also, not all supporters of "the project" [necessarily](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) support the addition of components to that system.  (This is a common source of misunderstanding, [confusion](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/confuse.md), [stress](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/stress.md) and [conflict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/conflict.md).)

Projects often require significant research and development.  Each project has a defining mission, but that mission can (with due permission) be changed, and can lead to unexpected results.  

Many projects are [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) which are often defined by constitutional [policies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/policy.md), and support many other policies.

A subproject is a project which is [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) by another project.
