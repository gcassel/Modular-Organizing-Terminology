#### Definition

*A project* is *a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [plan](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) which one or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) or [teams](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/team.md) [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [supports](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) during a specific [period](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md)*.

#### Notes

This intentionally expansive definition includes all organizations, [companies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/company.md) and [corporations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/corporation.md). It includes solitary as well as [collaborative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaborate.md) projects, and all subprojects at all [levels of design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level-of-design.md).
 Projects are often [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) by the intention to *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a specific [product](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/produce.md)*.  Projects often require significant research and development.  

Projects are [created](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) by [persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md), and are usually [officially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [supported](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) by one or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  (An unsupported project is often forgotten.)  Projects may be [sovereignly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sovereign.md) [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) or governed by other people or projects.  (Projects which are governed by other projects are [subprojects](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subproject.md)).  Each project has an [identifiable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) mission, but that mission can (with due permission) be changed, and can lead to unexpected results.  

Projects, or their [stewards](https://github.com/gcassel/IOT/blob/master/terms/steward.md), often [govern](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md), but that happens with highly variable degrees of [officiality](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) and [consistency](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/consistent.md).  Project-based systems are sometimes highly elaborate, as with massive [production](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/produce.md) systems and [companies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/company.md).  Note that the [supporters](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) of "a project" don't [necessarily](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) support related system.  (This is a common source of misunderstanding, [confusion](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/confuse.md), [stress](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/stress.md) and [conflict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/conflict.md).)

Many projects are [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) which are often defined by constitutional [policies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/policy.md), and support many other policies.
