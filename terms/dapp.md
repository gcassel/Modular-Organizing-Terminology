#### Definition

A *dapp* is a *[distributed computing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distributed-computing.md) [application](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/application.md)*.

#### Notes
Dapps can [provide](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/provide.md) one or more [computing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compute.md) [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) which can be [equitably](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/equity.md) [shared](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/common.md) by [p2p](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/p2p.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md). 

The computing functions of a dapp can include [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) [processing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md), [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) [storing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) and/or [hosting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/host.md).

As of 12 Feb 2019, [Holochain](https://holochain.org/) is the only fully distributed computing application which this author is aware of, and no complete (nor separately available) distributed computing [protocols](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/protocol.md) exist.  However, Holochain is still in beta form, and alternatives could emerge.  This author's [Inclusive Framework](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1-WFMRYdueSBba1atcohX0G585zj-gBNlBvZQBqnEmEs/edit?usp=sharing) includes [frameworks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/framework.md) for building dapps and dapp systems.
