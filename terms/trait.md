A trait is a *[relational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* which [identifies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) a "behavior"-- i.e., a *[type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [interactivity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md)* -- of *another* element within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Notes:**  [Participant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/participate.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/agent.md) may [believe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/belief.md) that identified traits are [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) in most if not all [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) contexts for the elements which those traits have been [assigned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) to.  However, only the most [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) and [accurate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) traits may approach that  *ideal* of *universality*.   

Many traits of *[language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md) elements*, including all *[representational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/representation.md) elements*, are *implicitly evident* and *tautological* by [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md).  By contrast, agents *[develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) [claims](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/claim.md)* of *[emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) traits* [uncertainly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/probability.md) by [conceiving](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) and [patterns](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/pattern.md).  Such conceived traits are technically *attributes* which can't be indisputably "proven".  However, some such attributes may be *consistently and [usefully](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) [agreed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agreement.md) upon* by all agents within a specific context.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), almost all (awake) [persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) seem to predictably *[experience](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) mass* as a trait of [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) *matter*, and experience *weight* as an additional trait of matter within a *gravitational* *field*.
 
Traits can be conceived and [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) by identifying [significantly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) interactive relationships between elements.

**See also [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) and [attribute](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/attribute.md)**, which are crucially useful *types of trait* (in different design [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)).
