#### Definition

A trait is one of the *[behaviors](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/behavior.md) of an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).

#### Notes

Depending on [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), traits can be [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) or [emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emerge.md).  Some traits of *[language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md) elements*, including all *[representational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) elements*, are [inherent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) by design.  By contrast, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) *[develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) [claims](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/claim.md)* of *emergent traits* [uncertainly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/probability.md) by *(inductively) [conceiving](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) and [patterns](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/pattern.md)*.  Such conceived traits are technically [attributes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/attribute.md) which *can't* be indisputably proven, and often can't be *disproven* either.  Nonetheless, some attributes may be *[confidently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/confidence.md) and [usefully](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) [agreed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agree.md) upon* by all agents within a specific [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) context.  

For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), almost all (awake) [persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) seem to predictably *[experience](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) mass* as a trait of [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) *matter*, and experience *weight* as an additional trait of matter within a *gravitational* *field*.

The context of [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) emergent traits is often [implied](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/imply.md) and un[stated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md).  While [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/agent.md) may [believe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/belief.md) that specific traits (even their own) are [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) in most if not all [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) contexts, only the most [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) and [accurate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) traits may approach that ideal of *universality*.   
 
Traits are conceived and [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) by identifying [significantly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) interactive relationships between elements.
