#### Definitions

*To federate* is *to [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) which [includes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) other collectives*.

*A federation* is *an [alliance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/alliance.md) of collectives which [recognize](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recognize.md) a [coordinating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordinate.md) collective.* 

#### Notes

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a federation* by *[developing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) a coordinating collective* which *[governs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md) [specifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md)* for other collectives to *[participate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) in*, and potentially *[identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) as a [member](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/member.md) of*, the federation. Depending on the [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) of the federation, such member collectives might or might not be [member-agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/member-agent.md). 

The definition above is [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md).  “Federation” has been applied to many [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) alliances with [varying](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md). For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), the coordinating agent of a federation [might](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/might.md) [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) that member groups *[may](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/may.md) [act](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) only as subordinate [subgroups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subform.md)* of the coordinating agent in some [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md).  However, some self-[identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) "federations" are alliances in which membership is (outside of extreme controversies) purely self-[assigned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md), and in which the member collectives always act [autonomously](autonomy.md).  Such alliances are *not* federations by this MOT [definition](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md).

Loosely-coupled federations, in which the member collectives do *not* submit to potentially [coercive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coerce.md) forms, can be called *confederations*.  However, this term is old fashioned, potentially confusing and probably unnecessary.
