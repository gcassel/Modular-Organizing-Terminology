#### Definitions

*To write* is *to [store](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md) in a [persistent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md) [medium](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md)*.

*Written* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of language which is held in persistent media.

#### Notes

For most of human history, all media was entered purely in solid physical forms; in [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md), writing is often still microscopically encoded in physical forms (e.g. persistent [structural](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) changes in circuitry), but can also exist evanescently as (nomadic) electrical signals.
