#### Definition

A *collective decision* is a *[decision](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decide.md) which [emerges](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) from a [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) by different [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)*. 

#### Notes

[Collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) often [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) *collective decisions* to *[commit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/commit.md) [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) shared [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* to [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md), [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) and [plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md).  

It's often *un[necessary](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md)* for [groups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of agents to make *collective decisions*, when their members could (instead) separately commit resources.  However, many actions, goals and plans *require a [significant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) (and possibly specific) amount of [investment](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/invest.md)* to even *[potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md)* be completed, or to fully complete specific [objectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/objective.md) (such as [subgoals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/substructure.md)) and *bonus goals*.   [Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often attempt to [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) group decisions when they're necessary, and they *also* often try to create them to unnecessarily increase their personal influence within a broad [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Collective decisions are often [developed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) according to specific [recipes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recipe.md).  These recipes often include [voting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/vote.md) by the [participants](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participant.md) in a [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md), or the *[member agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/member-agent.md)* of a group agent.
