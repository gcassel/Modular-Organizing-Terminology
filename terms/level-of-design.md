#### Definition

A *level of design* is *a [hierarchical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) level* which is [created](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) whenever any [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) *[functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) as a [component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)*.


#### Notes

Levels of design are often at least [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [present](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/presence.md) whenever [systemic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) are [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) or [specified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) with [sufficient](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/suffice.md) [strictness](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) to [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) valid development apart from their base system.  Such valid development could be done by the same agent(s) who created the base model, but it also [may](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/may.md) ([depending](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/depend.md) on [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)) be [autonomous](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/autonomy.md) or even [independent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/independent.md).

When components are autonomously developed, they become [extensions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/extend.md) of the [base](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [level](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level.md).

Due to the [contextuality](hierarchical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) of levels of design, they may develop in diverse relationships and in any direction.  (*will add examples*)

While levels of design are most basically and generally associated with *[intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)*, they exist in many or most [perceptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) and [descriptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md), including [reports](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/report.md) and [recordings](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/record.md).
