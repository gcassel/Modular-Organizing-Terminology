#### Definition

A *level of design* is *a [hierarchical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) level which is [created](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) whenever any [component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) of a [model](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) is [developed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) as a [valid](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/valid.md) [extension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/extend.md) of that model, or as an extension of another component within it*.


#### Notes

Levels of design are at least [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [present](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/presence.md) whenever any component is [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) or [specified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) with [sufficient](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/suffice.md) [strictness](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) to [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) valid development apart from its base model or component.  Such valid development could be done by the same agent(s) who created the base model, but it also [may](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/may.md) ([depending](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/depend.md) on [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)) be [autonomous](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/autonomy.md) or even [independent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/independent.md).

When components are autonomously developed, they become [extensions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/extend.md) of the [base](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [level](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level.md).

While levels of design are most basically and generally associated with *[intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)*, they exist in many or most [perceptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) and [descriptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md), including [reports](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/report.md) and [recordings](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/record.md).
