#### Definition

*Time* is the *[dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) of [changing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/change.md) [experience](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md)*.

#### Specialized Meaning

The [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) *time*, and [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) including it, are often used as *[relational traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relational-trait.md)* which [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) the *[position](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/position.md) in local time* that [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) or [events](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md) occurred, or are [planned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) for.  (For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a [person](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) may state that they walked to the park at the time of 4:30 pm, or a [computer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/computer.md) may [record](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/record.md) that a file's *time [received](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/receive.md)* was 8:28 am on 5 Feb 2017.)

#### Notes

[Persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) often [experience](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) [time](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/time.md) *and* [spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md) *[based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) on* a *[conceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) [sequence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) of (also conceived) [events](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md)*.  Each conceived [step](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/step.md) in such sequences [tends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tend.md) to *[practically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/practice.md) disregard* the space between *quickly [interacting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*.  

Because the distance between quickly interacting elements is normally disregarded, the [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) *time* is much more commonly [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) than the more *[socially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md)* and *[accurate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accurate.md)* term *spacetime*.
