#### Definition

*To train* is to *[intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [skill](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/skill.md)*.

#### [Potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [Traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of Training

Skills can often be developed by directly using them, especially if such use includes *[relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) [variables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md)* which [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md) the development of [adaptability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/adapt.md) and *improved [conception](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md)* of those skills.  However, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often use *training [programs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/program.md)* which develop skills in [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md), *repetitive* and (sometimes) *intentionally varied* ways.  

Training programs are especially associated with (much) training which is [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) or [facilitated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md) *by other agents*, including *teachers* and *coaches*.  However, agents often use self-governed training programs as well as many spontaneous and arbitrary intentional acts of training.
