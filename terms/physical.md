#### Definition

*Physical* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of all [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) and [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which *rational [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* can [directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) and reliably [experience](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md), and/or [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [record](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/record.md) with *sensor* [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md) within a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)*.
 
#### Notes

The [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) *physical* is [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md).  It's meant to be flexibly [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) while being both more [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) *and* more potentially [accurate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) than other potentially [contentious](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/contend.md) and [confusing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/confuse.md) terms such as "reality".
