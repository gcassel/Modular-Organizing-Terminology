#### Definition

A *post* is a *[role](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md), or a [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of roles*, which *is [officially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [assigned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md)*.

#### Notes

Most posts are [based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) on one [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) role; however, they often [authorize](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authorize.md) several sub-roles which are [intended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) to [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md) [effective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md) [performance](perform.md) of the basic role.  For example, a committee chairperson could have a set of many official [powers](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/power.md) which are [automatically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/automate.md) authorized by the chairperson post.  Such sets of official powers, while common, are often un[stable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/stabilize.md), and are frequently [modified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modify.md) as collectives [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md).

A post often [identifies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) a role which is *[uniquely](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) [assigned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assignment.md) within a specific collective*. However, a post can also define a [team](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/team.md).

#### Related Terms

*Position* and *title* are often used as synonyms of *post*.  However, those [terms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) have other uses which are more *[fundamentally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md)* in [modular](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modular.md) [organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md).  Therefore, they are used differently in [Modular Organizing Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology).
