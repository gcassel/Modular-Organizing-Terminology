A post is a *[restricted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restriction.md) [role](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md)*.

A post often but not always [identifies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) a ([simple](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/simplicity.md) or [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md)) role which is *[uniquely](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) [assigned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assignment.md)* within a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [group agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md)*.

Note: *Position* and *title* are often used as synonyms of *post*.  However, those [terms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) have other uses which are more *[fundamentally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md)* in [modular](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modular.md) [organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md).  Therefore, they are used differently in [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology).
