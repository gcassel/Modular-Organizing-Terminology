#### Notes

As [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/definition.md) here, *just* is a [technically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technical.md) [strict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md); it doesn't cover all aspects of [fairness](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fair.md) or [equity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/equity.md).  By contrast to justice, fairness and equitability are impossible to strictly [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) ; however, justice can "bend" toward those [principles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/principle.md) by consistently [developing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) the rights which are [offered](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/offer.md) to all [participants](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md), or to specific [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md), in a [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) such as a [community](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md) or [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md).
