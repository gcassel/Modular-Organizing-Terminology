#### Definitions

*To localize* is to *[specialize](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) the [scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md)* of a [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) according to one or more *[intended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [locations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/location.md) of [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md)*.  

*Localized* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which *have had their scope localized*, regardless of whether that reduction reflects *design [priorities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/prioritize.md)* or *[emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) [adaptation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/adapt.md)*.

#### Notes

Localization often reduces [spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md) scope, but may also reduce a *field* of *[potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) and [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md)* according to [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) relationships, including [communities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md) based on the *digitally* *distributed* [creation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) or [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) of [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md).
