*To predict* is *to [state](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md) [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) [probability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/probability.md) or [confidence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/confidence.md)* that one or more [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) or [conditions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/status.md) *will be [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) in a future [period](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md)*. 

*Predictable* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of all [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md), [conditions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/condition.md) and [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) which have an extremely high probability (sometimes verging on "certainty") of being actively [present](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/presence.md) in [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) or conditions.
