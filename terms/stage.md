#### Definition

A *stage* is *the [location](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/locate.md) of a [status](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/status.md)* in a *[sequence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) of [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)*.

#### Notes

A *stage* can be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) by the [steps](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/step.md) which have already been [completed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complete.md) and the step which should occur next.

*Stage* is often [associated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/associate.md) with highly [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) and [complicated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complicate.md) processes and [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).  Such processes and systems often [include](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) many [substructural](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/substructure.md) sequential *and* [parallel](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/parallel.md) processes. Substructural sequential processes can have any number of stages of their own.
