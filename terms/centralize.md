#### Definition

*To centralize* is *to [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) a [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)* so that it is *[hierarchically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) [based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md)* on (and often *[governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) by*) one or more *[parent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/parent.md) [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md)*.

#### Notes
		
*Centralized [organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md)* is [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) in many [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  Centralized organization and governance is extremely common in [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) contexts including many [cultural](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/culture.md), [economic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/economy.md) and [political](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/politics.md) forms.

Systems may be [created](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) in a *centralized [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)*, or [modified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modify.md) to *become* centralized.  
		
The historic development of centralized organization reflects many historic [limitations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md) of [technology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technology.md).  However, recent technological developments (including [telecommunications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/telecommunicate.md)) [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to *decentralize* many historically centralized [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).
