*A story* is *a [description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) of [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md)* which *[signifies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sign.md) a [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) [sequence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md)* in one or more [dimensions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) such as [spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md).

**Notes:**  

This entry will need some work to focus practically upon our perceptions of spacetime sequential processes, and to illustrate the profound importance of stories in developing relationships we perceive.
