#### Definition
*A collective* is *a [project](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md) which [collects](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collect.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md), and acts as an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)*, in one or more [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes
**Collectives include all [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) *and* informal organizations which collect resources of any [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md).**  Collectives include all [companies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/company.md), [corporations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/corporations.md) and governments.  Collectives govern all [official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [commons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/common.md), and [govern](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) many [networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md).    

Many [teams](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/team.md) are technically collectives, but they're often *sub-collectives*, and can be [accurately](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) [referred](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/refer.md) to as subprojects.

**Each *[group agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group-agent.md)* is either a collective or (more frequently) a [component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) of a collective.**  However, many collectives rarely if ever use group agents in any officially [recognized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recognize.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Collectives often [serve](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/serve.md) many agents in many ways, although they often [include](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) [bureaucracies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/bureaucracy.md) of [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) [coercive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coerce.md) [authority](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authority.md), and can even include *[inherently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) [violent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/violent.md) [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md)*.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), an army which roams and pillages territories is a collective.  In contrast, a nonprofit volunteer organization which creates charitable commons is also a collective.
