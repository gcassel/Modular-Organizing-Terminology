#### Definitions

*To design* is *to [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md), [modify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modify.md) or [eliminate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/eliminate.md) an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [plan](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md).

*A design* is *a [model](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) [created](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) by an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to [support](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) a specific [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md)*.

#### Notes

*Design* is deeply distinguished from *emergence* here.  Designed relationships are *[mediated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) by designed elements*, instead of [emerging](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emerge.md) directly from relationships.
