#### Notes

*Collective media* is a trait which *[creates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md)*; however, collective media items [tend](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tend.md) to be [formally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) [networked](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) with most if not all other items in each collective's set.
