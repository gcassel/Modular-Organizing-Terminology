#### Definition

A directory is a [map](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/map.md) which *[provides](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/provide.md) [directions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md)* for *[accessing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transport.md) [project-](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md)[related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) and/or [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)*.

#### Notes

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [developed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) directories to *provide directions for [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) transportation*, such as moving to a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) room in a building.  However, directories are now often associated with navigating [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md).

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) directories by [creating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) and [linking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md) multiple *[storage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) [locations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/location.md)* upon a specific *[storage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) [device](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md)* or *server*.  However, it's [possible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) to [distribute](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) the [hosting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/host.md) and [updating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/update.md) of *[community](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md) [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [items](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/item.md)* across many devices and servers which are [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) by different agents.  
		
Directories often link *media items* which have *[unique](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) [addressable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/address.md) [identities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identity.md)*.  However, [organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md) by unique identities can be supplemented, or even replaced, by the development of *[compound](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compound.md) [descriptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md)*.

#### Examples
_Add examples including Dewey Decimal System for an ID system based purely on numbering, and 2-3 other examples including digital directories_****
