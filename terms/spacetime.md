#### Definition

*Spacetime* is the *[complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md)* of [relative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [change](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/change.md).

#### Notes

[Persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) often [experience](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) [time](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/time.md) *and* spacetime *[based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) on* a *[conceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) [sequence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) of (also conceived) [events](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md)*.  Each conceived [step](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/step.md) in such sequences [tends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tend.md) to *[practically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/practice.md) disregard* the space between *quickly [interacting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*.  

Because the distance between quickly interacting elements is normally disregarded, the [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) *time* is much more commonly [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) than the more *[socially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md)* and *[accurate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accurate.md)* term *spacetime*.
