#### Definition

*Mutual* is a *[relational trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relational-trait.md)* which [indicates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) that *two or more [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* have the *same [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) with each other* in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
		
#### Notes

*Mutual relationship* [identifies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) many [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/important.md) [sets](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of elements.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), mutually related [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may often be identified as [peers](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/peer.md) within the context of their mutual relationship.
