#### Definition

*To consent* is *to [freely](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/free.md) and [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [approve](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/approve.md) the [presence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/presence.md) of a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) or [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md)* in a specific [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

*Consent* is [established](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/establish.md) approval of the presence of a specific action or activity in a specific social context.

#### Notes

Consent does not [indicate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) or [imply](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/imply.md) [preference](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/prefer.md).

Consensual actions and activities (within a mutual activity) do not [coerce](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coerce.md) any [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) *to [participate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) or not participate*, nor to relinquish any [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) [agreements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agreement.md).

Consent is often considered to only be [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) to an action's or activities' [participants](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md), plus other *[significantly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) [influenced](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/influence.md) [persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md)*.  However, it's often difficult or impossible to [effectively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md) [define](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) which people are significantly influenced by actions and activities; therefore, MOT does not define *consent* to [exclude](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/exclude.md) any [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [users](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) of the [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md).
