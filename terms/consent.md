#### Definition

*To consent* is *to [freely](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/free.md) and [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [approve](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/approve.md) the [presence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/presence.md) of an [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) or [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md)*.

#### Notes

Consent is often considered to be [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) among an action's or activitie's [participants](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) and [significantly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) affected persons.  It's often difficult to [define](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) who is significantly affected; therefore, MOT does not define *consent* to [exclude](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/exclude.md) any [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [use-cases](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use-case.md).

Consent does not [indicate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) or [imply](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/imply.md) [preference](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/prefer.md).

Consensual actions and activities (within a mutual activity) do not [coerce](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coerce.md) any [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) *to [participate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) or not participate*, nor to relinquish any [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) [agreements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agreement.md).
