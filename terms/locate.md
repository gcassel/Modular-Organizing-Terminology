#### Definitions

*To locate* is *to [determine](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/determine.md) an [element's](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) [position](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/position.md) or [region](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/region.md)*.

*A location* is *an element's position or region*.

#### Notes

Location is predominantly associated with [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/physical.md) dimensions, and with [representations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) of physical dimensions (as in 2D or 3D [modeling](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md)); however, location may be either [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/form.md) *or* [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/concept.md).
