#### Definition

*A format* is a [specification](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) for a *[type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)* which [coordinates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordinate.md) [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) with an [intended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [signaling](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

Formats must specify or imply the form or structure of data, and they also *can* specify [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) mediums as needed.  (For example, a 3.5" floppy disk is a specific format which includes the physical requirements of that floppy disk.)

A format can specify the size *and* [organizing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organize.md) [features](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/feature.md) of an intended form.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a [text](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/edit/master/terms/text.md) [document](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/edit/master/terms/document.md) format [could](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/edit/master/terms/could.md) [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/edit/master/terms/require.md) the [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/edit/master/terms/use.md) of [sections](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/edit/master/terms/section.md) which each [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/edit/master/terms/function.md) as a [component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/edit/master/terms/component.md) of the document, and could also require that each section *and* the whole document have a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/edit/master/terms/specific.md) [limit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/edit/master/terms/limit.md) for maximum number of characters.
