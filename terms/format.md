#### Definition

*A format* is a [pattern](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/pattern.md), [framework](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/framework.md) or [specification](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) for *[representing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

Formats often [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) the use of one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [languages](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md).  They must specify or [imply](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/imply.md) the [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) or structure of data, and they also *can* specify [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) mediums as needed.  (For example, a 3.5" floppy disk is a specific format which includes the physical [requirements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) of that floppy disk.)

A format can specify the size *and* [organizing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organize.md) [features](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/feature.md) of an intended form.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a [text](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/edit/master/terms/text.md) [document](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/edit/master/terms/document.md) format [could](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/edit/master/terms/could.md) [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/edit/master/terms/require.md) the [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/edit/master/terms/use.md) of [sections](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/edit/master/terms/section.md) which each [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/edit/master/terms/function.md) as a [component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/edit/master/terms/component.md) of the document, and could also require that each section *and* the whole document have a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/edit/master/terms/specific.md) [limit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/edit/master/terms/limit.md) for maximum number of characters.

#### Examples

1. Submission forms have formats which enable users to submit information such as name, email address, etcetera in specific data entry fields.  (These fields are typically indicated by lines on printed forms, or by boxes in digital forms.)  Each field may have its own formatting, such a language requirement which is often unstated, but implied by context.

2. The original published version of this text is a *markdown* file in English, shareable via hypertext transfer protocol and including html and other technical format, ultimately based in binary (digital) code.  These formats are machine readable, but only by devices with compatible operating systems.
