#### Notes
		
Note that as defined above, meetings do *not* include all in-person interactions.  The essence of meeting is mutual understanding of planned co-presence and attention.

Meetings are often [officially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [planned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) and [scheduled](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/schedule.md), but they may [emerge](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emerge.md) [spontaneously](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spontaneous.md).
