Collaboration is *cooperative [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md)* (or [interaction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md)) with a *[mutually](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mutual.md) [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md)* [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) of [creating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a *united* or [merged](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/merge.md) result.  

Collaboration can be [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) by identifying *[shared](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/common.md) goals* or *shared [plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md)*.

The [intended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) goal(s) of collaboration may [complexly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md) contain separately [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).  However, collaborators perceive value in a unified pursuit of those result(s).
 
Collaboration often occurs in[form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)ally and un[official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md)ly.  However, *[group agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md)* may officially (and [complexly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md)) [assign](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) *subordinate* work to *[subgroup agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/subgroup-agent.md)*.
