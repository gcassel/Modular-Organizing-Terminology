#### Definition

*To assume* is to *accept the [validity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/valid.md) of a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md)  [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)*.

*[premise](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/premise.md)*:  *Assumption* is often nearly synonymous with [premise](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/premise.md). However, premises are always [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to specific [designs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md).  Assumptions may be related to [beliefs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/belief.md) or [motivations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/motivate.md) *instead of* designs.
