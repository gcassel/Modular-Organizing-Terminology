#### Definition

*Authority* is the *[permission](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/permit.md) to [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md)* in a specific [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  

#### Notes

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) *[official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) authority* according to a [simply](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/simplicity.md) [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) *[presence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/presence.md) or [absence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/absence.md)*.  By contrast, unofficial authority is often in[form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)ally perceived as a subtly [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md)  of [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md).
 
Official authority is always [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md), and is rarely directly accepted (see [consent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/consent.md)) by *all* people whose [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) are [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [regulated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/regulation.md), [restricted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restrict.md) or otherwise [coerced](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coerce.md) by authoritative action.
