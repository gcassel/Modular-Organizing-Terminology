#### Definition

*Authority* is the *[permission](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/permit.md) to [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) or, unless disallowed, to [delegate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/delegate.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md)* in a specific [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  

#### Notes

Authority is purely about permission in MOT; it's not *[directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md)* related to [reputation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/reputation.md) and/or [credibility](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/credibility.md). 
 
[Official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) authority is always [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md), and is rarely directly accepted or [consented](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/consent.md) to by *all* people whose [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) are [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [regulated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/regulation.md), [restricted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restrict.md) or otherwise [coerced](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coerce.md) by authoritative activity.
