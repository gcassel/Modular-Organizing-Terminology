#### Notes

Sharing applies to resources of all [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md).  One very common form of sharing is *[sending](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/send.md) [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) to [channels](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/channel.md)*.   (This might or might not [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a [persistent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md) [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) resource.)
