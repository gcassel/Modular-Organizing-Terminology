#### Definition

A *subject* is *an element which [performs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) or [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md)*.
#### Notes 

Subjects can be [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  However, the term subject is not usually [restricted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restrict.md) to agents, nor to [organisms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organism.md), except within some [experimental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experiment.md) [research](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/research.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
