#### Definition

*To analyze* is *to [factor](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/factor.md) and/or [evaluate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/evaluate.md)* [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) *[elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) and [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md)* within a perceived [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).

#### Notes

*Analysis* can help [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to [perceive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) and [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) within forms and [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).  It can also [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) [confusion](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/confuse.md), however, when relationships between factors aren't [accurately](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) perceived.
