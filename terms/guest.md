#### Definition

A *guest* is an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) who (1) *[uses](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) a [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* but (2) *does not [participate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) in [governing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md)* that [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) resource.
	
#### Notes
  
*Guest* is a [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) for *[developing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) [communities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md)* which govern specific resources and [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) reach out to share those resources with non-governing agents.  It's also a fundamental concept for [event](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md) [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) and [event management](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event-manager.md), and tends to refer to all non-governing event participants.
  
Guest *roles* are often [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to the governance of specific [channels](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/channel.md), [locations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/locate.md), [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) and [events](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md).
