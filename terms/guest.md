A *guest* is an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) who (1) *[uses](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) a [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* but (2) *does not [participate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) in [governing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) that [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) resource*.
	
**Notes:**  
  
*Guest* is a [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) for *[developing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) [communities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md) which govern specific resources.   
  
Guest *roles* are often [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) to the governance of specific [locations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/location.md), [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) and [events](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md).
