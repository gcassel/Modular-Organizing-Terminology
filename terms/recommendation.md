Recommendation is a [relational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) indicating that a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) finds a specific element to be [desirable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Recommendations contrast with [requirements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md).

Agents may create recommendations to *[support](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) [creative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) [production](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/production.md)* or to *[govern](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md) [conceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) [risks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md)*.  

Recommendations of relationships between *[types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of elements* are often *[identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) as [guidelines](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/guideline.md)*.  By contrast, recommendations of relationships between [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific) [instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of elements are often *identified as recommendations*.   For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), recommendations of specific [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) for specific [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) can be [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) in *[group agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md) [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md)*.
