#### Definition

*A substructure* is *a [component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which is [required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) or [recommended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommend.md)* to [support](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) *[level](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level.md)* in a [hierarchical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).

#### Notes

A substructure *may or may not* be [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) by the [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) which governs the hierarchical form.  Both governedd and ungoverned hierarchial [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) are common in the early 21st century.  Humans are barely beginning to learn how to [justly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/just.md) [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) ungoverned hierarchical relationships.
