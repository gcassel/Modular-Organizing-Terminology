#### Definitions

*To receive* is to *acquire [access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md) to a [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [location](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/locate.md).

*Receiver* or *recipient* is an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) (often an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) which acquires access to a resource in a specific location.

#### Notes

*Reception* often [indicates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) *[intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) reception* by an *[agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* who *[governs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) a receiving [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)*.

*Receiving* often additionally indicates the reception of *non-scarce [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md)*.  However, it's also often associated with the reception of resources which are inherently scarce and/or [restricted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restrict.md).  For instance, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often receive *[rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md) to [access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md)* restricted resources.
