#### Definition

A toolset is a *[set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) of [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md)* which can be used together to *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) or [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md)* a [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [ability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ability.md) or [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of abilities.    

#### Notes

Specific *[groups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of tools* within toolsets are often [functionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) as [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) of [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).  However, each toolset may contain several separate systems.

Toolsets are often [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) to flexibly enable or facilitate [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md), highly [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) *[types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of actions.*
