#### Definitions

*Analog* is a *[trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md)* which *[directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) other information*.

*Analogous* is a [relational trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relational-trait.md) of two or more [patterns](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/pattern.md) which *are [similar](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/similar.md)* at a *[sufficiently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/suffice.md) low [level of detail](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level-of-detail.md)*.

#### [Specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) Meaning 

In [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) [processing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md), *analog* especially [indicates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) that *[data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) represents continuous [dimensional variables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimensional-variable.md)*.  Such analog data does not represent with *perfect [accuracy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md)*.  Its limited accuracy [degrades](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/degrade.md) through increased *distortion* and [noise](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/noise.md) when it is repeatedly [transmitted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md) or [replicated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/replicate.md).
