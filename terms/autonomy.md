#### Definition

*Autonomy* is *self-determination* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) such as a [community](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md), [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) or a [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md).

#### Notes

Autonomy is often used in the context of local or regional [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) which is subject to broader governance [policies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/policy.md), in contrast to the greater autonomy afforded by [sovereignty](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sovereignty.md).
