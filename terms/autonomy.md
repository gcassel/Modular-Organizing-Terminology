#### Definition

*Autonomy* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) who *[may](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/may.md) [self-determine](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/self-determine.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) such as a [project](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md), [community](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md) or [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md).

#### Notes

Autonomy is often used in the context of local or regional [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) which is subject to broader governance [policies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/policy.md), in contrast to the greater autonomy afforded by [sovereignty](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sovereign.md).
