*Agreement* is a [relational trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/relational-trait.md) which [indicates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) that *two or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [agree](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agree.md) on a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md)*.

**[Specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [Uses](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md):** 

*An agreement* is *a [statement](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md) which is [mutually](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mutual.md) [approved](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/approve.md)* by *all [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  

*An [official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) agreement* is an agreement which *has been [authorized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authorize.md) by a [governing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) agent* in a specific context. 

**Official agreements are [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) in many [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) contexts.**  

Official agreements must be clearly and demonstrably approved, often via the [signatures](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signature.md) of agreeing agents in [persistently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md) [stored](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [items](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/item.md).

**Notes:**

Agreements must be stated in a *[mutually](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mutual.md) [understood](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/understand.md) [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md)*.

*Agreements* often *[describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) [plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md)*.  However, the description of plans is just one [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) *[type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of agreement*.
 
[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) agreements through [discussion](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dialogue.md) and [proposals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/proposal.md).  Proposals and agreements may be developed through any combination of [sequential processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/sequential-process.md) and [parallel processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/parallel-process.md).
