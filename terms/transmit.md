*To transmit* is to *[transport](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transport.md) a [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md)*.

[Sources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/source.md) often [store](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) transmitted signals.  Thus, transmission often causes [replication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/replicate.md) of stored signals at the [destination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/destination.md).

Importantly, the *[use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) of shared [addresses](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/address.md)* can [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md) *simultaneous [transmission](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmission.md)* of [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) to large *[groups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of [authorized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authority.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)*.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a signal can be [automatically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/automate.md) transmitted to all *[member agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/member-agent.md)* of a [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md).
