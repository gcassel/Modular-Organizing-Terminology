*To practice* is *to [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md)* a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md).

*A practice* is *a specific activity which is intentionally and repeatedly performed*.

*Practical* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of *activities* which *can be [beneficially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/benefit.md) practiced*.

#### Specialized Definitions

In the [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) of [specialization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md), *to practice* is to *[repeatedly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/repeat.md) [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) and (hopefully) [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) a [skill](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/skill.md)*.

*Practice* often [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) using a skill *as a [component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) of [training](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/train.md)*.   However, practice may also refer to using skills as a component of any [role](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md).  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), lawyers practice law and doctors practice medicine.
