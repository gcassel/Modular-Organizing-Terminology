#### Definitions

*To relate* is *to [link](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md) or [group](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) elements.*

*Relationship* is *grouping and/or [interaction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) as a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)*.

#### Notes

Relationships are often described in natural [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md), at varying levels of [formality](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) or [strictness](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md).  Relationships can be formally [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) through [semantic triples](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/semantic-triple.md) which [link](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md)  [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) via *[relational traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relational-trait.md)* which *[identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/identify.md) groups (including [networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md)) and/or interactions*.

Relationship can also *[emerge](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/emerge.md)* or *be [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/design.md)* through the [coordination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordinate.md) of descriptive [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of apparently related elements.
