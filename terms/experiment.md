#### Definition

*To experiment* is to *[use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [concepts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concepts.md) within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)*, for the [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) of *[creating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) useful [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md)*.

#### Notes
		
Experiments often attempt to *[evaluate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/value.md) the usefulness of specific concepts* within specific contexts.  However, they may also attempt to *[identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) useful new concepts*.

[Effective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md) experimentation *[creates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) [conditions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/condition.md)* which *could [falsify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/contradict.md) a [false](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/false.md) concept*.
