#### Definition

An output is a [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) which (1) *is [created](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) or co-created by a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)*, and (2) *can be [accessed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md) independently of that process.*

#### Notes

Outputs often *exit* from [subsystems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subsystem.md) to be *[used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) as [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md)* in a [base](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) system.   

[Information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) can be easily [replicated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/replicate.md) and [transmitted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md) outside of a system without ever *exiting* that system.
