#### Definition

*Personal* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which *is [assigned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) to one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md)* in a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Specialized Definition

In common usage, *personal* elements are often *[social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) but [private](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/private.md)*.  For example, people often refer to "personal business" and "personal relationships" which include one or more other person.  Such elements are technically *interpersonal* as well as personal.

#### Notes

Since personal elements can be social, they are often closely [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to [cultural](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/culture.md), [economic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/economy.md) and [political](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/politics.md) elements.
