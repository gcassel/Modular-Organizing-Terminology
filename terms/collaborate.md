#### Definition

*To collaborate* is *to [work](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/work.md)* on a *[mutually](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mutual.md) [shared](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/share.md) [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md)* with the [intention](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) of *[creating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [products](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/product.md) together*.  

#### Notes

Collaboration can be [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) by *[identifying](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) [shared](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/common.md) goals* or *shared [plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md)*.

The intended goals of collaboration may [complexly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md) contain separately [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) goals or products.  However, collaborators perceive value in a unified pursuit of [developing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) those goals or products(s).
 
Collaboration often occurs in[form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)ally and un[official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md)ly.  However, a [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) may officially (and [complexly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md)) [assign](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) *subordinate* work to *[subgroups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/substructure.md)*.
