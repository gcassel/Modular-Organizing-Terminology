#### Definition

Level of detail is a [dimensional variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimensional-variable.md) which [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) *how much of the [complexity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md) in a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) has been [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md)* in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
		
#### Notes

Level of detail often [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) refers to descriptions which *are [models](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md)*.
		
The dimensional variability of level of detail is often described [simply](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/simplicity.md) and [generically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) with a few [relational traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relational-trait.md) such as *lower* and *higher*.
		
Models which describe *higher [hierarchical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) [levels](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level.md)* often describe their lower levels of organization with a lower level of detail.  However, it's possible to use a high level of detail in extremely complex models (at some risk of reduced [clarity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/clarify.md)).
