*Equity* is a *[trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md)* of [interactions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) (and [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md)) which *[distribute](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) [benefits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/benefit.md) impartially*-- i.e., without [significant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) influence from [bias(es)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/bias.md)-- according to the *[merit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/merit.md) of [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md)* by [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).
		
**Notes:** Equity can be easy to [measure](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/measure.md) in some relatively [simple](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/simple.md) [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) interactions.  However, equity can be very challenging to assess and to [agree](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agreement.md) upon in *[complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [socially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [creative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md)* interactions.
		
**[Specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [Meaning](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mean.md):**  In [monetary](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/money.md) [investment](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/investment.md), *equity* often [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) *[ownership](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/own.md) shares*.
