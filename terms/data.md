#### Definition

*Data* is *[information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md) or [format](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/format.md)*.  
 
#### Notes

Data could be any [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of information, but typically is [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md). 
 
[Digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) data is formatted as [units](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unit.md), [sequences](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) and [sets](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of *data [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*.  Each type of data element represents an intentionally informative element in a data format.  

Some data elements could be considered either [simple](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/simplicity.md) or [compound](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compound.md), depending on the *[level of detail](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level-of-detail.md)* at which complexly formatted data is viewed.  For example, each of the 26 letters in the English alphabet is a simple element in written language, but can be digitally encoded as a compound *[string](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/string.md) of bits* via the Unicode [standard](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard.md).
