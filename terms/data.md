Data is [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) within a specific [format](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/format.md).  
 
Data can be any [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of information, but typically is [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md). 
 
*Digital* data is encoded as units, sequences and sets of *data [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*.  Each type of data element represents an intentionally informative element in a data format.  

Some data elements could be considered either simple (atomic), [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) or  [composite](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/composite.md), depending on the level of detail at which complexly formatted data is viewed.  For example, each of the 26 letters in the English alphabet is a simple element in written language, but can be digitally encoded as a composite *[string](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/string.md) of bits* via the Unicode [standard](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard.md).
