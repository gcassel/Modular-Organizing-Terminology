Communication is [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) which [transmits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md) [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md).  Communication attempts to [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md), [mental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mental.md) *and/or* [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [ideas](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/idea.md).
 
Acts of communication may or may not be [intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md).  Intentional acts of communication may or may not be [received](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) by intended *receivers* and *recipients*.
 
Communication precedes acts of [coordination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordinate.md) and [collaboration](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaboration.md), and it’s [fundamentally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) *important* in [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) to [govern](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md) those acts.
 
Communication often occurs through [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md) and/or [formatted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/format.md) [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md).
