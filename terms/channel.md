#### [Definition](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) 

A channel is *a [field](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/field.md) or [path](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/path.md) which [enables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) [transmission](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md)* between *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) ([force](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md) and [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md)) [sources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/source.md) and [destinations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/destination.md)*.

**Specialized Definitions:** 

**Media channel:** *A [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) channel* is a *[field](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/field.md), [path](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/path.md), [location](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/locate.md), [meeting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/meeting.md), [event](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md) or [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md)* which *[enables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) the [transmission](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md) and/or [storage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) of one or more [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)*. 

**Digital media channel:** A [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) media channel is *a channel where one or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may transmit digital media resources via [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) [streams](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/stream.md) and/or [messages](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/message.md)*.

**Media Storage Channel:** Storage channels are channels which [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) or [update](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/update.md) [persistent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md) [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md). In digital networking, media storage channels either create, update or replicate media items, which may be [files](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/file.md) but may also more granularly represent interactive fields and related permissions.  For example, a storage channel can enable Agent 1 to create Document A which *includes* Table i, and another storage channel can enable Agent 2 to submit Form x to create a new record in Table i.  (This example is a rough placeholder example to indicate the potentials for intricately but systematically networked governance of media channels.)  Media storage channels enable [repositories](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/repository.md).
		
#### Notes

Channels carry forces and signals between [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) in systems, or (more specifically, when [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md)) between [interfaces](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interface.md).

Countless channels and [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of channel exist, and many are expansive.  (For example, an electromagnetic wave can propagate throughout the observable universe.)  However, [communications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communicate.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) often [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) *[specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) channels*.  Specialized channels are often [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md).  Governed channels are often [gated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/gate.md) to reduce [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [harm](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md) and [noise](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/noise.md).

***Channel* is an [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md)** in [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md).  Digital channels *[enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to [send](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/send.md)* (and [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) *stream*) signals to two *[basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [receivers](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/receive.md)*:
* local or remote *networking [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md), or [sets](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of components*
  * These may include electronic [displays](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/display.md), relays and [storage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md).
  * note: in [distributed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) networking, receivers may be identified as *[instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md)* instead of as [unique](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) receivers.
* [addresses](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/address.md)  

Authorization to use digital channels is [technically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technical.md) [regulated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/regulate.md) by regulating the [distribution](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) of [computing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compute.md) [devices](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md) and, sometimes, [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [keys](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/key.md).

Signal sources and destinations are often [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md) by different agents.  **Each agent (using a specific [identity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identity.md) and a [compatible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compatible.md) [application](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/application.md)) may be separately [authorized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authorize.md) to send and/or [receive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/receive.md) signals from each channel.**  
		
For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), one agent may be authorized to send a *video + voice signal* to a channel which many other agents can simultaneously receive that signal (and other signals) from.  

Specific networks or [communities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md) may allow (and directly enable) agents to extend their channel usage rights to [delegates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/delegate.md), which could be other agents *or* [bots](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/bot.md).
		
[Persistent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md) channels are often *[technically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technical.md) [able](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ability.md)* to receive signals at all times.  However, sending and receiving authorizations for specific agents may be granted persistently *or* [temporarily](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/temporary.md).  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), an application may [permit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/permit.md) a specific address to only receive video signals during a 1:00pm to 2:00 pm [meeting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/meet.md), and specific agents may only be permitted to send audio (via microphones) during certain [periods](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md) within that meeting.
