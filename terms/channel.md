*A channel* is a *[signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) [address](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/address.md)*.

More [specifically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md), a channel is an address which *[identifies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) a [signal-](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md)[destination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/destination.md)*.
		
**Notes**:  ***Channel* is an extremely [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md)** in [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md).

Channels *[enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* to [send](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/send.md) (and [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) *stream*) signals to two *[basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of destination*:
* local or remote *networking [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md)*
  * These may include electronic [displays](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/display.md), relays and [storage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md).
* *other channels*  

Signal [sources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/source.md) and destinations are often [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md) by different agents.  Each agent (using a specific [identity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identity.md) and a [compatible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compatible.md) [application](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/application.md)) may be separately [authorized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authorize.md) to send and/or [receive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/receive.md) signals from each channel.  
		
For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), one agent may be authorized to send a *video + voice signal* to a channel which many other agents can simultaneously receive that signal (and other signals) from.  
		
Authorization to use channels is [technically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technical.md) [regulated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/regulate.md) by regulating the [distribution](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) of *digital [keys](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/key.md)*.
		
[Persistent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md) channels are often *[technically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technical.md) [able](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ability.md)* to receive signals at all times.  However, sending and receiving authorizations for specific agents may be granted persistently *or* [temporarily](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/temporary.md).  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), an application may [permit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/permission.md) a specific address to only receive video signals during a 1:00pm to 2:00 pm [meeting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/meet.md), and specific agents may only be permitted to send audio (via microphones) during certain [periods](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md) within that meeting.
