#### Definitions

*To persist* is *to remain [present](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/presence.md) throughout a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [period](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md)*.

*Persistent* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of any [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which *is [predicted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) to remain indefinitely present* in a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

*Persistent* is a *[strictly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [durable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/endure.md)*.  A persistent element is [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) to be so durable that any [probability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/probability.md) of ending, such as *[functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [failure](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fail.md)*, can be [effectively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md) ignored for a specific *[period](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md) of prediction*.

Persistent is often a [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) trait in [strict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md), [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) for [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) *[data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md)* instead of [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md).   This is partly because [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) data can be indefinitely [replicated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/replicate.md) and [distributed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) across many network [nodes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/node.md), [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [including](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) [autonomous](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/autonomy.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) and [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [redundant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/redundancy.md) nodes.  Distribution and redundancy can greatly reduce [risks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md) of failure.  Such [security](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/secure.md) can be developed in many systems, including biological reproduction, [computing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compute.md) systems and "word of mouth" [communication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communicate.md).

* *permanence*:  [Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) *permanence* in [ways](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) which are [practically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/practice.md) synonymous with *durable* or *persistent*.  However, *permanence* has also often been used for (non-logical) [claims](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/claim.md) about [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) supposedly lasting forever, or existing outside of the *[spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md) continuum*.
