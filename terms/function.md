#### Definitions

*To function* is *to [support](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)*. 

*A function* is *an [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) which supports a specific system*.

#### Notes 

**Function is a [crucial](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/crucial.md) systemic [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md)**, because all systems [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) from *[related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) functions* which *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) [emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emerge.md) processes*.

Functions can always be [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) in [relation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to supporting [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) processes or systems, even if they [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) new [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), [actors](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) can support a process by creating [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) which *[serve](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/serve.md) as [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md)* in that process. (Bone marrow supports the circulatory system by creating red blood cells; etcetera.)
