#### Definition

A *semantic link* is a *[link](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md)* which *[identifies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) one or more [relational traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relational-trait.md)* for two or more linked [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).
		
#### Notes

Semantic links create [semantic triplets](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/semantic-triplet.md), although triplets are also generated in many other ways.

Semantic links *may* be [hyperlinks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hyperlink.md).  The [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) hyperlink [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) can be very [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) in some [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Relationship to predicates:** Semantic links may create, or be adapted into, *subject-predicate* [grammatical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/grammar.md) [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).  However, predicates and grammatical forms often [assume](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assume.md) or [imply](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/imply.md) the objects of actions or relationships, instead of directly identifying them as semantic links do.
