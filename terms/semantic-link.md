#### Definition

A *semantic link* is a *[link](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md)* which *[identifies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) one or more [relational traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relational-trait.md)* for two or more linked [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).
		
#### Notes

Semantic links create [semantic triples](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/semantic-triple.md), although triples are also [created](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) in many other ways.

Semantic links may [include](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) [hyperlinks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hyperlink.md), although the meaning (/semantics) of most hyperlinks is merely implied.

**Relationship to predicates:** Semantic links may create, or be adapted into, *subject-predicate* [grammatical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/grammar.md) [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).  However, predicates and grammatical forms often [assume](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assume.md) or [imply](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/imply.md) the objects of actions or relationships, instead of directly identifying them as semantic links do.
