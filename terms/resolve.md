#### Notes

Personal problems may be personally resolved; however, [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) problems must be socially solved.

In most [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), resolution does not [imply](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/imply.md) that all related problems have been resolved; it refers to one [issue](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/issue.md) or a sub[set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of problems in a larger context.
