#### Definition

Applications are *[software](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/software.md) [programs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/program.md)* which [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to *[complexly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [customize](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) the [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) of [computers](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/computer.md)*, beyond the functions which are *[directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) [created](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md)* by *computer [hardware](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hardware.md)* and *[system software](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system-software.md)*.
		
#### Notes  

An application creates a new [interface](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interface.md) between a computer's [I](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md)/[O](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md) [devices](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md) and its system software .  It typically includes a *user  interface* which [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [coordinates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordinate.md) and conceals other [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) of the apps, as well as the system software and the rest of the (non-I/O) hardware which the app [inherently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) [depends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) upon.  Such user interfaces intend to enable app users to [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) *clearly [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) functions* by intentionally [interacting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interact.md) with nothing other than the computer's I/O devices and the app's user interface.
