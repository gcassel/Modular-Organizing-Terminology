#### Definition

A tool is a [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) which is an *[input](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) to a [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) which does not [consume](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/consume.md) or [fundamentally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [transform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transform.md) that resource*.


#### Notes

Many tools [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) the [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) of other resources, such as fuel.  

Many tools only [work](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/work.md) when used by [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  However, some tools can work [automatically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/automate.md).  [Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) use tools to *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) or [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md)* many [abilities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ability.md).

[Physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) tools are subject to [degradation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/degrade.md).

In most [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), agents only consider a resource a *tool* if it performs a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) function *predictably and reliably*.  Exceptions may be [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) in some [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) which create art which is *[intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [randomized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/random.md)* within specific [parameters](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/parameter.md).

**Synonyms:**  
* *Device* is synonymous with tool.  Devices are usually (but not necessarily) *[complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) tools* which include multiple [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md).

**[Specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) Synonym:**  In *[digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md)* [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), *device* [tends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tend.md) to [mean](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mean.md) *a digital networking tool*.
