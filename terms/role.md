#### Notes

Agents often [serve](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/serve.md) roles in [networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md), [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) and [group agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group-agent.md). 

Each role has one or more *[requirements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md), [authorizations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authorize.md) and [accountabilities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accountability.md)*.

*[Complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) ongoing roles* are often referred to as [posts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/post.md)  or *occupations*.
