#### Definition

A role is a *[functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md)* which an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) has with one or more *agents or [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)*.

#### Notes

Agents often [serve](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/serve.md) roles in [projects](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md) and [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md).  (Projects and collectives are resources.)

Each role has one or more *[accountabilities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accountability.md) and [authorizations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authorize.md)*, although they often remain un[defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md).  Many roles also are [exclusively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/exclude.md) [assigned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md), and have prerequisite [requirements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md).

*[Complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) ongoing roles* are often referred to as [posts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/post.md), positions  or *occupations*.   (Note that *position* is defined much more [generically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) in MOT.)
