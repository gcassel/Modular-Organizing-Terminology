#### Definition

A *node* is *an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/agent.md) or [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) or [event](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/event.md)* which *is [linked](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md) to a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/specific.md) [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/network.md)* by one or more [paths](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/path.md). 

#### Notes

Nodes often [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/enable.md) or [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/perform.md) [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/base.md) [systemic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/system.md) [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/function.md) such as *[transforming](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transform.md) and [transporting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transport.md) resources*.

To perform functions upon [transported](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/transport.md) elements, nodes may *[modify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/modify.md) or [replace](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/replace.md)* a specific *pathway [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/element.md)* for each path which meets at the node.   Nodes can replace pathway elements when necessary by [providing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/provide.md) [interfaces](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/interface.md) which [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/enable.md) them to [receive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/receive.md) transported elements as [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/inputs.md), to perform functions upon them, and to [send](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/send.md) those elements onward as [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/outputs.md) which are [compatible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/compatible.md) with the pathing [requirements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/require.md).
