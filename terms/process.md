#### Definitions

*To process* is *to [change](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/change.md) one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) into [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md)*.

*A process* is *an [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) or [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) which (1) [uses](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) one or more [identifiable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md)* and *(2) [produces](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/produce.md) one or more specific [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md)*.  

#### Related Terms

*[system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)*: All systems [support](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) processes, but not all processes *[represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) systems* or *[serve](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/serve.md) systems*.

#### Notes

Some processes can transform inputs almost [directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) into outputs, with minor and [imperceptible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) [influence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/influence.md) by other [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).  However, [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) between inputs and outputs are often [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) and [complicated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complicate.md).
 
*[Designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md)* processes [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) specific inputs, and may also *[permit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/permit.md)* or even *[recommend](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommend.md)* other non-required inputs.
 
[Identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) processes often *[function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) as [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) in systems*.  Functional processes are often [engineered](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/engineering.md) to identify *all* inputs, activities and outputs which seem [significantly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

An identified process may occur [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) *or* [actively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) within a specific context.
