A process is an [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) which (1) [uses](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) *[inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) and (2) [creates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) one or more specific [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md)*.  

**Notes:**

Processes *may* [transform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transform.md) inputs [directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) into outputs.  However, the [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) between inputs and outputs can be [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) and [complicated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complicate.md).
 
*[Designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md)* processes [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) specific inputs, and may also *[permit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/permission.md)* or even *[recommend](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommendation.md)* other non-required inputs.
 
[Identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) processes often act as [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) which are [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) in [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).  Functional processes are often [engineered](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/engineering.md) to identify *all* inputs, activities and outputs which seem [significantly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

An identified process may occur [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) *or* [actively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) within a specific context.
