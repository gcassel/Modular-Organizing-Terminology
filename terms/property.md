#### Definition

A property is an *[inherent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) or [required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
   
#### Notes
Properties include the following:

1. traits which are directly generated by design processes
2. traits which are technically required and/or explicitly defined in a specific relationship
3. traits which are clearly and consistently inherent to the very nature of a concept or phenomenon

Properties cause specific [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) in specific [conditions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/condition.md).

*Property* is often [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to *the [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) of [ownership](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/own.md)*.  However, that concept is de-emphasized in [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/) in favor of *[distributed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) [access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md) and [usage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) [rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md) and [responsibilities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/responsibility.md)*.

The *inherent* nature of a property in an active element does not imply *inevitability*.  Properties can change via [transmutation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmute.md), [transformation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transform.md) and [emergence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md).  Nonetheless, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may often dis[agree](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agree.md) about what is or *isn't* inherent in-- and thus, a property and not an **[attribute](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/attribute.md)** of--a specific element.  *Attribute* is [recommended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommend.md) for traits which aren't clearly and uncontroversially inherent to an element within a specific context.

MOT suggests a [formally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) [strict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) approach which only *[assigns](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) properties* based on *deductive* reasoning and analysis.  MOT suggests identifying all *inductive and abductive qualitative claims* as attributes which are *not* properties.   (However, it's not MOT's role to strictly prescribe terminology.) 

#### Examples
1. Product X is a green shirt.  Green is currently a property of the shirt.
2. The *[quantity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/quantity.md) of 3* is a property of *a [group](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of three cats*.
3. mass is a property ofÂ [matter-energy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/matter-energy.md).
4. two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom are properties of a water molecule
5. if a person draws a green circle, green and circle are both properties of that shape
6. if a submission form has a 500 character limit, that 500 character limit is a property of the form
