A property is an *inherent [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md)* (of an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Examples:** 
* Product X is a green shirt.  Green is currently a property of the shirt.
* The *[quantity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/quantity.md) of 3* is a property of *a [group](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of three cats*.
* *Mass* is a property of [matter-energy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/matter-energy.md).
		
**Notes:**  The [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) *property* is also often [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) to *the [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) of [ownership](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/own.md)*.  However, that concept is de-emphasized in [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/).

The *inherent* nature of properties does not imply *inevitability*.  Properties can change via [transmutation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmute.md), [transformation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transform.md) and [emergence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md).  Nonetheless, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may often dis[agree](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agreement.md) about what is or *isn't* inherent in-- and thus, a property and not an *[attribute](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/attribute.md)* of--a specific element.

I suggest a [formally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) [strict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) approach which only *[assigns](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) properties* based on *deductive* reasoning and analysis.  I suggest identifying all *inductive and abductive qualitative claims* as attributes which are *not* properties.   (However, I don't consider it MOT's role to strictly prescribe terminology.)
