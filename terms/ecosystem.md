#### Definition

An *ecosystem* is a [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) which is *at least partly [based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) on [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) between [organisms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organism.md)*.

#### Notes

Each ecosystem is *a system of systems*, because each organism is a system.  Ecosystems can have many multidirectional *[hierarchical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) [levels](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level.md)* which [link](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md) many [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) and [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md).
