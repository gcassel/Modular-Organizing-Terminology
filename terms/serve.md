*To serve* is *to [provide](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/provide.md) a [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [input](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) or [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)*.

*A service* is *an [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) which provides a functional input in a specific system or process*.


#### Notes

*Service* is closely [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to *function*; however, note that service is a more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) term, in addition to its flexibility in representing both inputs and functions.
