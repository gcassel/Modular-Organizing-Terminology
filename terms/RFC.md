#### Definition

*An RFC* (or *request for comments*) is a [request](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/request.md) for [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to *[comment](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/comment.md) on a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [media item](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media-item.md)*, or to *[participate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) in [dialogue](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dialogue.md)* which is [linked](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md) to a specific media item.

#### Notes

A specific RFC may [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) as an   [invitation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/invite.md) instead of a request for most [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) participants.  However, each RFC *functions as a request* within a specific [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

The [Internet Engineering Task Force](http://ietf.org/) uses the term RFC according to their own [unique](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) [specification](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md).  That specification is highly [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) for IETF's [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md); however, it's *too specific* for [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [MOT](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/) use of the term "RFC".
