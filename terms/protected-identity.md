#### Definition

A *protected identity* is *any [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md), [identity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) or [identifier](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identifier.md) which a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [project](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md) or [community](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md) [protects](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/protect.md) from [biased](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/bias.md) [behaviors](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/behave.md)*.

#### Notes

Protected identities are often [inherent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) traits which would be impossible or nearly impossible to change, including [classes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/class.md) which are [legally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/law.md) protected in many [jurisdictions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/jurisdiction.md), such as national origin, religion, ethnicity, color, sex, gender and disability.  Protected identities can, however, be of any type which a specific project or community (1) can [administratively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/administer.md) afford to protect and which (2) strengthen their shared identity and purpose.
