#### Definition

*To optimize* is *to [adapt](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/adapt.md) an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* to be *as [beneficial](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/benefit.md) as [practically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/practice.md) [possible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

*Optimization* is an idealized goal.  (It could be possible to fully and clearly optimize some elements, but impossible to clearly optimize others in complex contexts.)
