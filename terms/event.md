#### Definition

*An event* is *an [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) or [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) during a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [period](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md)*.
 
#### Notes

*Event* is a [fundamentally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) for *[designing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) and [planning](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) activities*, including [meetings](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/meet.md) and *[sequences](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) of activities* such as conferences and conventions.  It's also fundamentally useful for *[reporting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/report.md) specific [instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of action and activity*. (Thus, *event* is specified as a key type of [governance resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance-resource.md) in [Inclusive Organizing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_KwMbdghVVv1FODuy21QsXXXHsAKTLGc0YGT64oh0mg/edit?usp=sharing).)

The period during which an event occurs is often defined directly as an interval of time, but it can also be indirectly [based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) on [prerequisite](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/prerequisite.md) actions. **[Examples:](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md)** Event X starts on May 11 at 9am and ends on June 3 at 4pm.  Event Y starts when L amount of preproduction [remuneration](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/remunerate.md) has been [generated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md), and ends when Action R has been completed.  

In many or most cases, *non-chronologically defined events* are located purely by their [position](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/position.md) in a [planned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) [sequential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md).  For example, a [recipe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recipe.md) typically [describes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) *a linear sequence of cooking events*.
