Reaction is [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) which is *caused by other [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) action(s)*.
 
**Notes:**  *Action-reaction [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md)* can sometimes be *[usefully](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md)* in [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) which contain *[sequential processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/sequential-process.md)*.  

Most reactions can be more [accurately](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) and [precisely](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) identified as [factors](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/factor.md) in [parallel processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/parallel-process.md) which *simultaneously influence all acting [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*, including any [participating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md), in [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) *unpredictable* ways.  However, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) "actions" and "reactions" in parallel processes to *[intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [limit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md) [complexity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md)* and to *[prioritize](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/prioritize.md) [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md)* within specific [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
