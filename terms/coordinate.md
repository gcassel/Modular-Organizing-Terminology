*To coordinate* is *to [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md)* two or more [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)-- often, [agents'](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) or [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)-- to [support](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md). 
 
**Notes:** 

The goal of *coordination* may be to [govern](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) specific [risks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md).  For instance, the activities of two or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may be [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [transformed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transform.md) to reduce [conflict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/conflict.md) or risky [competition](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/competition.md).
 
Coordination often occurs un[officially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md).  However, [group agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md) may [assign](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) coordination [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) to *[subgroup agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/subgroup-agent.md)* or to [personal agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal-agent.md).  

A coordination [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) (or any *other* function) which is assigned to a subgroup agent often becomes [collaborative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaboration.md) work *within* that subgroup.
