#### Definitions

*To identify* is to *[assign](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md)* which *[sufficiently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/suffice.md) distinguish a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) from similar elements* in a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

*Identity* is *one or more traits* which *sufficiently distinguish a specific element from similar elements* in a specific context.

#### Notes

Identification is especially associated with assigning traits such as *[constant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/constant.md)* [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) or *[variable-](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md)type: [value](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/value.md)/name* to [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) or [conceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) [instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of those type. 

*[Naming](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/name.md)* is a [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of identifying.
