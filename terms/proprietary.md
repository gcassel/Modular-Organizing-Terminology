#### Definition

*Proprietary* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/trait.md) of any *[resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/resource.md) which is [provided](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/provide.md) by an [owner](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/own.md) who retains one or more [exclusive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/exclude.md) [legal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/law.md) [rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/right.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/specific.md) [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/context.md).

#### [Specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/specialize.md) [Meaning](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/mean.md)

[Use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/use.md) of the [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/term.md) *proprietary* has almost always seemed to [imply](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/imply.md) the exclusively retained legal right to *[require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/require.md) payment in [money](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/money.md)* for others' use of the resource in question.  However, it's debatable whether or not that right should be deeply separated from all other exclusive legal rights.  (Note that some [open licenses](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/open-license.md) create [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/intend.md) [inclusive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/include.md) rights which don't [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/create.md) or [support](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/support.md) *any* [restrictions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/restrict.md).)
