#### Examples
1. Cosmolocal organizing can include relationships and activities among a small group of people in a local neighborhood, who share interest in their natural environment and infrastructure (streets, water supply etcetera) as well as locally significant cultural issues.
2. It can also include relationships and activities in a huge global network of people with any shared interest.  It could, in fact, include any combination of geographic and/or conceptual factors which people share an interest in.
