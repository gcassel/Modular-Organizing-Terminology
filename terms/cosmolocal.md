#### Examples
Cosmolocal organizing can include relationships and activities among a small group of people in a local neighborhood, who share interest in their natural environment and infrastructure (streets, water supply etcetera) as well as locally significant cultural issues.  It can also include relationships and activities in a huge global network of people with any shared interest.  It could, in fact, include any combination of geographic and/or conceptual factors which people share an interest in.
