#### Definition

A level is a *[network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of [organized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* which *occupies a [position](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/position.md)* within an *[ordered](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/order.md) [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md)*, *[system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/system.md)* and/or *[hierarchy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md)*.

#### Notes

Each level gives one or more [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) to any higher levels which are [based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) on it.  The base level may or may not [govern](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) the higher level.

At least two levels are [present](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/presence.md) in all [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md), because each system has one or more [emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emerge.md) [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) which are not present in its [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md).

Levels of organizing often include, define or describe [sequence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md); however, levels of organizing are about [creative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) origination and (when applicable) [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md), not sequence per se.
		
Relationships *between* levels of organizing are often described [simply](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/simplicity.md) and [generically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) with a few [relational traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relational-trait.md) such as *lower* and *higher* or *deeper* and *higher*.   Other [terms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) which relate levels of organizing include *[component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md)*, *[substructure](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/substructure.md)*, *infrastructure* and *[superstructure](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/superstructure.md)*.
		
[Models](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) and [maps](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/map.md) often one level of organizing at a much higher [level of detail](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level-of-detail.md) than others.  However, it's possible to use a high level of detail in very [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) models, at [risk](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md) of reduced [clarity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/clarity.md) and [legibility](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/legibility.md).
