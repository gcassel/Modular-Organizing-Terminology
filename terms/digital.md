#### Definition

*Digital* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) (and of [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md)) which *[represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) as a [sequence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) of 0s and 1s*.

#### Notes

Digital data often represents [qualitative variables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/qualitative-variable.md).  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), each of the 26 letters in the English alphabet (and of many alphabets) is digitally represented via the [Unicode standard](http://unicode.org/standard/standard.html). Digital data *also* often represents [dimensional variables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimensional-variable.md).  For example, *[analog](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/analog.md) [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md)* are often represented as digital data.  

Digital data is never identical to analog data.  However, the *information loss* (and the resulting *[significance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) of abstraction*) of digital data can be *[practically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) eliminated* by encoding with sufficient *bit depth*.   Digital data isn't subject to the *predictable and inevitable [degradation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/degrade.md)* which analog data experiences when repeatedly [replicated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/replicate.md), [transmitted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md) or [processed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md), so digital data is a [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) of most large *signaling and [computing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compute.md) [networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md)*.
