#### Notes

*Commons fund* is closely [associated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/associate.md) with the modern business practice of *petty cash funding*.  However, a commons fund can use resources other than [money](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/money.md).
