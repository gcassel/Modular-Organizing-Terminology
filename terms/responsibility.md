**[Specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [Meaning](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mean.md):**  In [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), *responsibility* often [indicates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) than an agent's [performance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) of one or more [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) is deeply [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) for the future of a specific relationship or [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md).

Responsibility often [identifies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) interacting relationships *between [participants](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md)* or *between participants and resources* within specific contexts.
