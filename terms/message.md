#### Definition

*To message* is *to [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [send](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/send.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md)* to an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).

*A message* is *a specific [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) which is intentionally shared in one or more specific [channels](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/channel.md)*.
		
#### Notes
		
[Data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) is often [transmitted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md) in *[intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) separated messages* instead of by *[streams](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/stream.md)* in *open channels*.   Such intentionally separated messages are a [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [item](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/item.md).

For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), agents often use the ENTER key or a *Send* button to intentionally transmit *all data [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) within a specific data [entry](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/add.md) [field](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/field.md)* to other agents.   Agents interact this way through "instant messaging" [applications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/application.md), email, and the vast majority of *website [interfaces](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interface.md)*.  
		
[Digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) messages may contain any type(s) of digital data, including inline (contained and labeled) media items and [hyperlinks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hyperlink.md).

However, that [necessary](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md) [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) can be realized by [using](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) deeply different systems of messaging and storage.
