A group is any *combination of separately [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*. 

**Notes:** 

**Group is an [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) term which *includes* all [sets](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) and all [networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md).**  

Each group of elements can be more [accurately](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) as a *set or network* at a specific [level of organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/level-of-organization.md).
