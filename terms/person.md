**Definition:**

A person is a *[unique](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) individual organism which has [agency](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Plurals:** 

*persons*, *people*, *peoples*

The term *peoples* is sometimes used to [indicate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) the [presence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/presence.md) of multiple [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of person in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Notes:**

Personhood is often [exclusively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/exclude.md) [associated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/associate.md) with human beings, but that's variable and debatable.

[Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/) includes *[strict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) [specifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md)* for [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md), *[group agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group-agent.md)* and [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md), and [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) avoids [confusing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/confuse.md) or [conflating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/conflate.md) the term *person* with group agents and [machines](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/machine.md) which may hold [delegated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/delegate.md) agency.
