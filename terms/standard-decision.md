#### Definition

A *Standard Decision* is a decision which (1) is *not* clearly within the limits of a Minor Decision, but (2) *clearly does not exceed* the highest of any following values:
 
* any applicable Personal Standard Decision Authorizations
* any applicable Team Standard Decision Authorizations
* (if implemented) the Collective Standard Decision Authorization


#### Examples

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20 and its Standard Decision Authorization is $200, then it would be a Standard Decision to give $50 of sample products to a customer.

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20 and its Standard Decision Authorization is $200, but you have a personal [post](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/post.md) to distribute up to $50 of free samples per week, then it would be a Standard Decision for you to distribute more than $50, but less than $200, of samples per week.

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20 and its Standard Decision Authorization is $200, but you're acting outside of the scope of your [team](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/team.md) [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) *and* your personal post(s), then distributing $50 of samples would be a Standard Decision.

#### Notes

Agents should document every Standard Decision which changes any resources which we track on spreadsheets, including inventory items.
