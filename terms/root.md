#### Definitions

A *root* is one of the following:

1. *the lowest [hierarchical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) [level](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level.md) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)*, or is an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) on that lowest level
2. any element which otherwise serves as an irreducible [basis](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) of a [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md)

#### Notes

[Complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md) systems often contain many [systemic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) which each [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) as the root of one or more additional hierarchical levels.
