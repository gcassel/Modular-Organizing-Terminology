#### Definitions

*To mediate* is *to [transport](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transport.md) [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) or [force](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md)* from one [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) to another.  

*A medium is an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) which (1) [includes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md)* or (2) *[transports](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transport.md) [force](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md)*.

*Media* is the *[type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md)* of *all [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) which include data*.

#### Notes

***Media* and *media item* are [uniquely](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) [terms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) in [MOT](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/).**  They're both nouns based on a verb, but *media* is nonetheless [established](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/establish.md) as the [root](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/root.md) term (in this [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md)-[focused](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/focus.md) [terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/terminology.md)) because of its [systemic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) importance and because it's [simpler](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/simplicity.md) than any equivalent verb forms.  While *media* is [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) *more [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md)* in [MOT](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/) than the plural of medium would be, it is nonetheless an extremely [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) term which can be applied to all "[information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)".

*Media items* [limitlessly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md) includes [diverse](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/diverse.md) mediums and formats including notes, pamphlets, books, computer programs, and all [recorded](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/record.md) signals such as photographs, etcetera.

Most media [items](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/item.md) have "dual lives" as [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) *and* [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) forms.  While media items can be purely [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md), [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)  [share](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/share.md) conceptual media by [integrating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/integrate.md) the conceptual forms into physical forms such as sound waves, paper, electrical [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md), memory chips, etcetera.  *[Digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) electronic media*, for [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), can often be [replicated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/replicate.md) and [distributed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) with little [cost](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/cost.md) to [senders](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/send.md) or [recipients](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/receive.md).

In addition to inhabiting physical forms, media also often [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) sensory forms such as visual and/or acoustic data.  Such sensory forms often further represent [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md) and *nonlanguage* data.

Most media [items](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/item.md) are [portable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/portable.md); however, media also [includes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) (for [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md)) written inscriptions on buildings and monuments.
