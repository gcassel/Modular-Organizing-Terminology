*To instruct* is *to [state](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md) [intended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) or [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md)*.
		
*Instructions* are usually given to *other [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)*.   However, agents may [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) instructions for themselves to [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) in [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
	
**Notes:**  *Instruct* complements the other *[basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [indicative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md)* of *[state](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md)* and *[ask](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ask.md)*.

Useful instructions [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md) shared context.  That context may often be [implied](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/imply.md) in specific instructions.   However, instructions do often include specific [details](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/detail.md) about their intended context.
