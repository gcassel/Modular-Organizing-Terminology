#### Definition

*To instruct* is *to [sufficiently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/suffice.md) [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md) a [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md)*.
	
#### Notes  

*Instruct* complements the other *[basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [indicative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) actions* of *[state](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md)* and *[ask](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ask.md)*.

*Instructions* are often given to by [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to *other agents*.   However, agents may [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) instructions for themselves to [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) in [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  Agents may also *instruct* [programmable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/program.md) [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md), including [computers](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/computer.md).

Useful instructions [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md) shared context.  That context may often be [implied](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/imply.md) in specific instructions.   However, instructions do often include specific [details](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/detail.md) about their intended context.
