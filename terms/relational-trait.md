#### Definition

A relational trait is a *[trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md)* between two or more [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).

#### Notes

Relational traits may be *directionally* described (relating *subjects* to *objects*).   By contrast, they are *undirected* (or *[mutually](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mutual.md) [shared](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/common.md)*) when elements *[act](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) as [peers](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/peer.md)* within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
