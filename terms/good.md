#### Definition

*A good* is *a [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) which can be [offered](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/offer.md) for [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [transfer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transfer.md)*.

#### Notes

Goods are distinguished by *transferability*; by contrast, [services](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/serve.md) can't be transferred.

*Goods* are often [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) and [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md) in [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md).
