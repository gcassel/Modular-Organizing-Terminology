#### Definition

A *Minor Decision* is a decision which has *a gross collective [cost](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/cost.md)* which *clearly does not exceed* the *highest* of any following values:

1. an applicable Personal Minor Decision Authorization
2. an applicable Team Minor Decision Authorization
3. (if implemented) the Collective Minor Decision Authorization 

#### Examples

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20, then it would be a Minor Decision to give $18-$19 of sample products to a customer.

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20 but you have a personal Accountability to distribute up to $50 of free samples per week, then it would be a Minor Decision to distribute any samples until that limit is hit.

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20 but you're acting outside of the scope of your Project's Accountabilities *and* your personal Accountabilities, then distributing *any* free samples would be a non-Minor Decision. (Probably a [Standard Decision](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard-decision.md), unless you're giving away a huge amount of products.)

#### Notes

Document every Minor Decision which changes any resources which we track on spreadsheets, including raw ingredients and Inventory items.
