#### Definition

Cost is a *[dimensional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md)* which [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) the *practically irreversible loss of one or more [agent's](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) subsequent [ability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ability.md) to [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* due to [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) which affects that resource.

#### Notes

Cost is a trait of actions and activities which alter, destroy, or remove access to a resource. [Potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) actions may be [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) by [describing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) their potential costs (or [risks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md)). [Reports](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/report.md) of *past* actions may describe cost(s) which were [experienced](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) or directly [measured](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/measure.md).

Each cost can be indirectly or directly translated into a monetary total for the ([inherently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) [contextual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)) fair market value of a resource which has been lost.  Such calculations are straightforward for monetary and material resources.  They’re difficult for social resources; however, rough estimates (which allow broad margins for error!) can be very useful when making difficult decisions.

*[Risk](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md)* may be considered a [subtype](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subtype.md) of cost.
