#### Definition

*Intercommunity* is *the [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of [communities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md).*

#### Notes
		
Most if not all communities already have in[direct](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) and un[official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) networked [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) with each other.   Many communities also are directly related via the [official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md).  

The [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) *intercommunity* reflects the [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) that *all group agents are [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md)* (and [inherently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inherent.md) *artificial*.)     To fully explore intercommunity [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md), [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) could combine *[consent-based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/consent-based.md) [decision](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decide.md) [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)* with [inclusive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) [options](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/option.md) for [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) *[access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md), [participation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md), and [distributed version control](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distributed-version-control.md)* for [agreements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agree.md) at all *[hierarchical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) [levels](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level.md)* of [complexly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) related [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) and [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md).   Agents could also [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) *per-[person](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) agreements* which flexibly [granulate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/granulate.md), aggregate and [iterate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/iterate.md) official relationships across the [limits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md) of existing group agents and networks.
		
Some "feed-based" [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) activities already suggest the potential [power](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/power.md) of intercommunity.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), people can join and leave many Facebook groups, subreddits or *team chat channels* whenever they desire to, dynamically customizing their [interactions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) and [experiences](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) with those networks.  Group agents could extend such dynamically [localizing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/localize.md) [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) to the development and [distribution](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) of consent-based agreements, as well as the [discussion](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dialogue.md) [topics](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/topic.md), [forums](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/forum.md) and [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md) which agents [link](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md) to them.
