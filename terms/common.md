#### Definitions

**n.**  *A common* is *a [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) and [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* which *[authorizes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authorize.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [community](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md) to [access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md) those resources at will* according to one or more [standards](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard.md).
		
**adj.**  *Common* is a *[relational trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relational-trait.md)* of an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which *has the same [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) with all elements* within a specific group.

**[Specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [Form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)**:  *The commons* may [generically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) indicate *a [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of all commons* which a specific group of agents has rights to access at will.   *The commons* is also, sometimes, used even more generically to indicate *all commons which are accessible for all [persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md)*.
		
#### Notes

*Common* is often also [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) to [indicate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) that an element *[tends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tend.md) to frequently be [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md)* within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  However, that [meaning](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mean.md) is too [vague](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/vague.md) for [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/).
