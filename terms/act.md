#### Definitions

*To act* is *to [change](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/change.md) one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* during a specific [period](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md).

*An action* is an act or [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) which causes *a specific change in an element* during a specific period.

*Active* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of an element which *can [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) act* within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes 

Actions can be [classified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/class.md) by these [primary](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md): 

#### *[compound](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound.md), [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md), [destroy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/destroy.md), [damage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md), [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md), [emerge](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emerge.md), [modify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modify.md), [transform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transform.md), [transmute](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmute.md), [transport](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transport.md), [transmit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md), [transfer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transfer.md), [transact](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transaction.md)*  

The above types of action [influence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/influence.md) *[agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) and/or [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* in [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md), [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md), [cultural](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/culture.md), [economic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/economy.md) and [political](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/politics.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).   

Agents may directly [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) or *be identified with* "acts" or "actions" via [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) in [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) social contexts.

Action may be [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) [vaguely](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/vague.md) and gradually *or* through discrete "quantum" shifts between the [presence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/presence.md) or [absence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/absence.md) of elements, [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) or [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md).  Gradual action can be [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) by identifying intervals of time (or [locations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/locate.md) in [spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md) *during which* [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) action occurred. 

Most actions and [reactions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/reaction.md) can be clearly identified within a larger context of [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) simultaneous [interaction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md).  However, agents rarely bother to thoroughly describe interactions, partly for these practical reasons:  

1. Agents, and many other complex *adaptive* [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md), are closely related to *[regulation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/regulate.md) and [repair](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/repair.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)* which [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) them to create [significant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) action *without* deeply influencing their specific traits.  (These regulating and repair systems may sometimes be distinguished as [subsystems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subsystem.md) or as external *[support](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) systems*.)

2. Many interactions occur between elements of such vastly different [scales](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scale.md) that it seems practically impossible-- and unimportant-- to identify significant changes in most of the interacting elements.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), it’s unimportant (to humans, so far) to identify the influence of an *accelerating* automobile upon the *velocity* of the Earth, which technically does have an “equal and opposite” *inertial* reaction.  Likewise, it’s unimportant to determine the  *microscopic* (tidal) influence of the moon’s gravity upon a puddle.  

On a closely related note, many *abundant* and *easily [accessed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md)* resources, such as oxygen for respiration, are generally taken for granted ([assumed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assume.md) and ignored) by most if not all agents within specific contexts.
