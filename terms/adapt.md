To adapt is to *[change](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/change.md) an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* to *increase its [fitness](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fitness.md) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)*.

Elements may be adapted to increase their fitness in [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) *or* [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) contexts.
