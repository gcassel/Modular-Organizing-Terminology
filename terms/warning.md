#### Definition

A warning is a [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) which *[indicates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) a [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md)* between an [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) and a *[damaging](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md)* action.
 
#### Notes

Warnings are often but not inevitably [coercive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coerce.md).  Warnings are also often but not inevitably [threatening](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/threat.md).  By contrast, the [intentions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) of warnings can be purely *helpful* and [informative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md).  For example: *if* an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) performs Action A, *then* Action B will probably occur-- regardless of whether or not the warning person performs Action B, or in fact has any agency which seems [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) to the [probability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/probability.md) of Action B.
 
Warnings often describe *potential [protective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/protect.md) action*. Such protective action could *[restrict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restrict.md) others' potential actions* without otherwise damaging them.  However, protective use of force may also sometimes create *predictable and unavoidable [risk(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md) of unintended damage* to the [subjects](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subject.md) of restrictive force.
