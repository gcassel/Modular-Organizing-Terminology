#### Definitions

*To direct* is to *[provide](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/provide.md) [required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md)* for a *[specific](https://github.cob.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md)*.  

*A direction* is *required information for the [performance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) of a specific action.* 

*Direct* is a [relational trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relational-trait.md) of all [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) which *do not [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) intermediate action(s)*.
		
#### Notes

Direct actions often seem to occur quickly or instantly, but can occur over any [period](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md).  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), water can directly dissolve many [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [substances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/substance.md) (even highly resistant ones) over extended periods.
