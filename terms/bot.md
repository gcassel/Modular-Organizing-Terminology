#### Definition

*A bot* is a [software](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/software.md) [program](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/program.md) which *[performs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) [automated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/automate.md) [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) on a multi-[agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [computing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compute.md) [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md).*

#### Specialized Definition

Bots may often *[perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) which have been [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) for [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)*.

#### Notes
		
Bots often perform [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) which are or *aren't* [officially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) permitted *or* [restricted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restrict.md) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Examples: Bots often perform repetitive [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) such as the *web-crawling* which [builds](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) many web *search engine [indices](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/index.md)*.  Bots are also [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) sometimes to exploit online [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) which [generate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generate.md) [desired](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) [currencies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/currency.md).  This often happens in *multiplayer online game [economies](https://github/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/economy.md)*.  

Bots may be *officially [assigned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md)* as *[valid](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/valid.md) [delegates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/delegate.md)* for [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) within [strictly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/definition.md) contexts.

As increasingly [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) and [adaptive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/adapt.md) [abilities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ability.md) are developed for bots, they may perform increasingly [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) and [varied](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) roles for agents.
