#### Notes

The significance of investments may be [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) or [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md).

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often use *commitments* as social [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) (and [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md)) which *[intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) their [reputation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/reputation.md)* in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) social [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) to their [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) of their commitments (and related investments) within that context.
