#### Definition

*True* is a *[relational trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relational-trait.md)* of a [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) which *is [valid](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/valid.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)*.
		
#### Notes

The [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of *truth* may be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) as a *[qualitative variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/qualitative-variable.md)* or a *[dimensional variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimensional-variable.md)* in varying contexts.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), an indication may be identified as simply *true or [false](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/false.md)* depending on whether or not *all elements in the indication have valid [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md)* within a specific context.   [Alternatively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/option.md), the *presence/absence* of truth may be identified as a [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) from 1-0 / 100%-0%.

Truth can [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) be well-[defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) in contexts of pure [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md).  In *[modelling](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)*, however, the concept of truth is *[fundamentally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [complicated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complicate.md):*

1.  The [relevance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) of *truth [claims](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/claim.md)* to physical systems [depends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md) on *falsifiability*, per Karl Popper and other 20th century philosophers of science.
2.  Even with apparently falsifiable claims, the concept of truth ignores the uncertainty (and [probabilistic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/probability.md) nature) of future [experience](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md).  That simplification can be *extremely* [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) in [practice](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/practice.md), but it can also [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) major mis[understandings](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/understand.md).
		
Additionally, whether or not an indication or [description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) *is true* does *not* indicate how much [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) it contains.  Nor does truth indicate that a description is *strongly [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md)* to a specific context in which it's true, *or* that it's *at all* relevant to the context(s) in which [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) *share* it.
		
Truth is an extremely [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) concept.  This entry could especially benefit from further [development](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) and examples.
