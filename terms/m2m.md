#### Notes

M2m relationships are conspicuous and highly [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md) in [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md), although such systems are also [based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) on [h2h](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/h2h.md) relationships.
