#### Definition

*To model* is *to [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) and [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) [representational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

*A model* is *a representation of [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) or [theorized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/theorize.md) elements and relationships.*  

#### Notes

Models often [include](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) [constant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/constant.md) *and* [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) elements.

Models often represent [emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) *or* [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md). 

#### Generic Example

A model may represent a [probability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/probability.md) which no one designed and no one [desires](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md), but which nonetheless seems to be an [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) element of [shared](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/common.md) [experience](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md).
