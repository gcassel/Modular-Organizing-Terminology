#### Definitions

*A technique* or *method* is a [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) which an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) can [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) *to [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md)*, or to creatively *pursue a specific [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md)*.

*Technical* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of any [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md), such as process or [problem](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/problem.md), which is *(1) [inherent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) to or (2) highly [predictable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/contexst.md)*, due to *non-[personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) and non-[social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [factors](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/factor.md)*.

*Methodical* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) which *consistently use a specific method* in *[clearly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/clarify.md) [definable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) [conditions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/status.md)*.

#### Notes

A technique is the [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [tool](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md) which [facilitates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md) the [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) of other tools; therefore, it's acceptable for the term "tools" to mean "tools and techniques".

Specific techniques often [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) external (non-bodily) [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md), [ingredients](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ingredient.md) and/or [skills](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/skill.md).

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) can [confidently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/confidence.md) [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) non-problematic technical processes *if* they [consistently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/consistent.md) adhere to all [rules](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rule.md) and [guidelines](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/guideline.md).  Likewise, agents can confidently [believe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/believe.md) that a technique *will [fail](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fail.md)* if a [crucial](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/crucial.md) technical problem is present.

*Technical* processes and problems can be [inherent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) to [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).  They can also *seem* to be inherent to [emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emerge.md) systems, but this is often subject to rapid and unpredictable change.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a technically reliable process can become unreliable if the context changes, and a technically impossible problem can become possible if the context changes.  For example, if it seems technically impossible for a [person](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) to get to work on time, it can become possible (and successful) if a benefactor loans them a working vehicle.  *(More examples will help here.)*

Note that a problem is *not* [primarily](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) technical if it's [based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) on an agent [violating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/violate.md) [accessible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md) [rules](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rule.md).
