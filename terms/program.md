*To program* is to *[customize](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) a [tool](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md)* to *[automatically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/automate.md) [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)* according to one or more [rules](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rule.md).

**Specialized Meaning:** *A program* is a *[media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* which *[represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/representation.md) a [recipe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recipe.md)*. 

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often use the term *program* to represent recipes which they [intend](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) to automatically perform, regardless of whether or not they [strictly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) [govern](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) the performance of those recipes.

Some [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md), including [computers](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/computer.md), can be [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) to automatically perform specific programs.
