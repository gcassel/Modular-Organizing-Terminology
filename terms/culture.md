#### Definition

*Culture* is *the [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of [principles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/principle.md) and [practices](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/practice.md) which are, to highly [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) [intensities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intensity.md), [supported](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)* such as a [project](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md) or [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md).

#### Notes

While purely [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) such as attitudes and behaviors *aren't* cultural per se, it *is* cultural to (socially) [recommend](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommend.md) personal traits to others.   For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), to [claim](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/claim.md) that all individuals should be self-sufficient would be a cultural [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md).
