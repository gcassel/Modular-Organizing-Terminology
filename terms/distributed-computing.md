#### Definition

*Distributed computing* is *[computing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compute.md) which is [distributed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) [equitably](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/equity.md) among all [participants](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md)* in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) computing [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md).

#### Notes

Fully distributed computing [requires](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) distributed *[signaling](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md), [processing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) and [storing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) of [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md)*.

As of this writing (20 Feb 2019), fully distributed computing has only been prototyped and practiced at small [scales](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scale.md). However, some aspects of distributed computing have already happened on massive scales; for [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), distributed [file](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/file.md)-[sharing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/share.md) via Bittorrent and similar [protocols](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/protocol.md).
