#### Definitions

*Confidence* is a *[dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) which [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) intensity of [belief](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/believe.md)*. 

*Confident* is a *[trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of a [perception](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md)* which *has high confidence*.

#### Notes

The confidence of [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) in [concepts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) and [statements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/statede.md) is [rationally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/true.md) [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to how much [accurate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) they can [access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md) in the [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Confidence in this [general](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) *MOT* context can be [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) as a [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md), but agents will probably *self-[report](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/report.md)* it in most [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) contexts.   By contrast, *statistic confidence* is a *[strictly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) specialized [calculation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/calculate.md)* (and may eventually acquire its own MOT entry.)
