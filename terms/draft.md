#### Definition

A draft is a *[unique](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) [instance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md)* of a [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) [version](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/version.md) which is *not* an [official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [edition](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/edition.md). 

#### Notes

"Draft" is an [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of resource.  However, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may consider it synonymous with *work-in-progress*, and exclusive of *archival media*.  Agents may even consider "draft" to be synonymous with *current instance*.   (*Work-in-progress here!*)
