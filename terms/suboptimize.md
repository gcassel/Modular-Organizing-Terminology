#### Definition

*To suboptimize* is *to [optimize](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/optimize.md) a [component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) instead of its [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)*.

#### Notes

*Suboptimization* is a problem mainly in well-defined [hierarchical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) systems where a component is clearly a [subsystem](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subsystem.md) which [depends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) upon a specific parent system.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), it's often a [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) problem in [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) in which subsystems have [unfairly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fair.md) [exploited](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/exploit.md) collective [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) (including [decision-making](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decide.md) [authority](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authority.md)) which have been [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [invested](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/invest.md) in them.
