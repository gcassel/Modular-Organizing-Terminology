#### Definition

Position is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) which *[represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md)* either: 

1. one or more *[unique](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) [values](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/value.md) within [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) [dimensions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md)*

2. *[inclusion](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) within the [limits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md) of a specific [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)*

#### Notes

Position is predominantly associated with [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/physical.md) dimensions, and with [representations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) of physical dimensions (as in 2D or 3D [modeling](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md)); however, position may be either [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/form.md) *or* [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/concept.md).

**Position as value:** Position may represent either *[ordinal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/order.md) or [interval](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md)* value in a dimension, or in related dimensions such as [spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md).  In interval [measurement](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/measure.md), however, position [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) represents either a *[point](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/point.md)* or *an interval of extremely small [scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md)* within the *[active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) dimension*.  This extreme specialization contrasts with the [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) *large* relative scope of *position as inclusion* (see below).

**Position as inclusion:** Examples:
1. "The nose is on the face"
2. "Cats live on Earth".

"Inclusional positions" can be very extensive. For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), the position of *Earth* is very large (but [meaningful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mean.md)); it indicates that an element (perhaps an [organism](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organism.md)) occupies a biosphere which extends for 196.9 million miles above and below the surface of the planet Earth.  (In most cases, organisms are positioned at or very nearly at the surface of Earth, or within bodies of water; however, Earth's biosphere extends vertically for several miles.)

*[post](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/post.md)*: Posts are often called positions in specific [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md).  This is fine as long as [meanings](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mean.md) are [mutually](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mutual.md) [understood](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/understand.md); however, MOT must reserve the term *position* for its much more [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) and [flexible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/flexible.md) usage here.

*[region](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/region.md)*: Regions can be defined as [sets](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of positions.
