#### Definition

Position is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) which *[represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md)* either: 

1. one or more *[unique](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) [values](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/value.md) within [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [dimensions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md)*

2. *[inclusion](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) within the [limits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md) of a specific [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)*

#### Notes

**Position as value:** Position may represent either *[ordinal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/order.md) or [interval](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md)* value.  In interval [measurement](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/measure.md), however, position [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) represents either a *[point](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/point.md)* or *an interval of extremely small [scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md)* within the *[active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) dimension*.  This extreme specialization contrasts with the [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) *large* relative scope of a [location](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/location.md) within a dimension.

**Position as inclusion:** Examples:
1. "The nose is on the face"
2. "Cats live on Earth".

*[post](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/post.md)*: Posts are often called positions in specific [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md).  This is fine as long as [meanings](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mean.md) are [mutually](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mutual.md) [understood](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/understand.md); however, MOT must reserve the term *position* for its much more [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) and [flexible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/flexible.md) usage here.

*[region](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/region.md)*: Regions can be defined as [sets](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of positions.
