#### Definition

*A template* is *a [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [model](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md)* which *can be [customized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/customize.md) to [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md) [efficient](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/efficient.md) [production](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/produce.md) of a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* in a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

Templates can be [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) to produce [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) resources *or* any type of [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md).

#### Related Terms

Templates are often [frameworks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/framework.md).  However, templates don't [necessarily](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) *[include](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) [frames](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/frame.md)*, so they're not always frameworks. 

Frameworks aren't necessarily templates, but they often include templates and can *be* templates.  For example, a *web framework* is a *[developmental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) framework* which often includes default or even "boilerplate" code [modules](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/module.md), which are customizable templates.
