#### Definition

*A region* is *a [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of [positions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/position.md)*.

#### Notes

Regions can sometimes be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) by [indicating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) all positions within them; however, they are much more often identified by their [parameters](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/parameter.md).
