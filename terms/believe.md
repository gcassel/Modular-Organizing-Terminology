#### Definition

*To believe* is *to [persistently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md) [perceive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) that a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) is [true](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/true.md)* throughout a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [interval](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) of [time](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/time.md).

#### Notes

*Believe* is an extremely [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md). 

*Belief* is often associated with very long-term perceptions.  However, the term may [accurately](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) *brief perceptions* when the context of its [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) is sufficiently [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md).  (For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a [person](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) may [state](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md) that they ran away from a specific stranger because they [mistakenly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mistake.md) *believed* that the stranger [planned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) to attack them.)
