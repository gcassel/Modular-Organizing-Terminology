#### Definition

*To represent* is *to [report](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/report.md) or [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) with [signs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sign.md)*, including [symbols](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/symbol.md), which *re-present [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*.

#### Specialized Meaning

*A representation* is *a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) which represents another form.*

#### Notes

Representations usually represent forms.  They can only represent unformed or pure elements within well-[defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Representations often represent forms by using different elements and [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md); however, a representation may re-use any number of [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md).

Representation often [translates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/translate.md) elements into [fundamentally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) different [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), we often represent [experiential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) elements as [ideas](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/idea.md) which we [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) *to each other* with [concepts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md)-- and, our concepts often represent [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md), [mental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mental.md) *and* [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [experiences](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md).
