#### Definition

*A subproject* is *a [project](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md) which is [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) through another project.*

#### Notes

[Collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) often [delegate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/delegate.md) the governance of subprojects to a variety of [official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) or [posts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/post.md) within the collectives, including shared posts ([teams](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/team.md)).  Also, post-holding [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often self-organize by creating their own subprojects.  [Sustainable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) governance and project [management](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/manage.md) ultimately require clear distinction between the subprojects of collectives and of the projects and roles *within* them.  

Project and subproject relationships can extend indefinitely throughout the [hierarchical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) [levels](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level.md) of a large collective.
