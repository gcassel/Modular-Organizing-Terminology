#### Definition

A *governance resource* is a [model](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) which *[functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [officially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) in the [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) of one or more [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)*.

#### Notes  

Governance resources are often [maps](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/map.md).  

Most governance resources are generated within diverse (and often inconsistent) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) and [formats](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/format.md).  By contrast, [Modular Organizing Recipe](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ssWfsuaKQkytdW1q83qKzEjxrY-BoreREch46JOMQY/edit?usp=sharing) (MOR) and related documents recommend a [standardized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard.md) system for [developing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) governance resources and [formally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) relating them to each other via [resource description frameworks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource-description-framework.md) within an [official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) governance system.

Governance resources often *include or [link](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md)* models and maps of other valued resources, including [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) resources, and can also include or link [recordings](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/record.md).  (See also [subject resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subject-resource.md).)  Governance resources are widely [developed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) and used in varied [formats](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/format.md), often by large [bureaucracies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/bureaucracy.md) which are controlled by small groups of people. They can also be developed [modularly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modular.md) by [p2p](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/p2p.md) teams in [distributive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) [networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md).
