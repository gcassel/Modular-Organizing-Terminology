#### Definition

*Intensity* is the *[value](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/value.md) of [presence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/presence.md) of a [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [force](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md)* in a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

Intensity is often informally estimated on a [scale](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scale.md) of *none* to *very intense*, very roughly and informally corresponding to typical 5 point [ordinal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/order.md) [evaluative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/evaluate.md) scales.
