#### Definition

An input is a [component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) which *must be added to start or [sustain](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)*.  
#### Notes

Inputs are [fundamentally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) to the [development](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) of all processes and [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).

Inputs *are [acted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) upon* by components, usually in ways which significantly alter them.  In all cases other than *catalysts*, inputs are significantly changed by the process, and can no longer serve as the *same* input.  (However, they can create [outputs](Inputs *are [acted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) upon* by components, usually in ways which significantly alter them (and make them unable to act again as the same input).
output.md) which become inputs in a "closed" system.)

Inputs include ingredients, supplies, fuel, and anything else which a system acts upon to create internal or systemic outputs.
