#### Definition

An input is a [component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) which *one or more [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) [acts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) upon to [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) an [output](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md)* in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md).  

#### Notes

Inputs are [fundamentally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) to the [development](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) of all processes and [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).

Inputs are distinguished from other components by the fact that _they are added to start or sustain a process._  In all cases other than *catalysts*, inputs are significantly changed by the process, and can no longer serve as the *same* input.  (However, they can create outputs which become inputs in a "closed" system.)
