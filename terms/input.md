#### Definition

An input is any [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) which *[interacts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) during a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)*.  
#### Notes

Inputs are [fundamentally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) to the [development](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) of all processes and [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).

Inputs are often significantly altered by interactions, and can rarely serve more than once as the *same* input unless they are a well-[maintained](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/maintain.md) systemic [component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md).  (However, altered inputs can create [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md) which become inputs in a "closed" system.)

Inputs include ingredients, supplies, fuel, and anything else which a system acts upon to create internal or systemic outputs.
