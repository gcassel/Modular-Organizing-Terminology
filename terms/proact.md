*To proact* is *to [act](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) to reduce or increase a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md)*.

*Proactive* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/proactive.md) of an action which is [intended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) to reduce or increase a specific potential.

#### Notes

*Proactivity* often [relates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to specific [risks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md) or [opportunities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/opportunity.md).

Proactivity tends to [imply](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/imply.md) addressing potentials which aren't highly [legible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/legible.md) to many or most [participants](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) in a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
