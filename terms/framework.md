#### Definition

*A framework* is a *[network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of [frames](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/frame.md)* which *[functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) as a [base](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md)* to *[enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) or [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md)* the [hierarchical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) (and, sometimes, [modular](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/module.md)) [development](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) of a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)*.

#### Notes

A *framework* functions by *[linking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md) frames* which each hold a formal [component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) which can develop in various ways, depending on the framework's [specification](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md).  A framework is, technically, a component itself; it’s a component which provides “[connective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/connect.md) tissue” (and, often, creates connective [issues](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/issue.md).)

Frameworks can be used to develop many [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) and [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md).

A framework can [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) as the basis of a [recipe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recipe.md).

It’s often unnecessary and undesirable to [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) or [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) a framework for a small system of components which are directly connected to each other, or are very simply connected via unspecialized [mediums](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/medium.md) or [channels](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/channel.md).  However, most science and engineering--and much other design work, too-- is implicitly based on designing or describing a framework of reasonably well-defined components, interfaces and connectors (mediums, links or channels).  This is the standard, tried-and-true way of designing or describing highly complex and specialized structures, whether with strictly separated machine parts or the fluids, membranes and biochemistry of organisms.

#### Related Terms

*[template](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/template.md)*: Templates are often frameworks. However, templates don't necessarily include frames, so they're not always frameworks.  Frameworks aren't necessarily templates, but they often include templates and can be templates. For example, a web framework is a developmental framework which often includes default or even "boilerplate" code modules, which are customizable templates.

*[policy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/policy.md), [protocol](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/protocol.md)*: Policies and protocols are often [primary](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) of frameworks.  (Note also that policies often contain protocols.)
