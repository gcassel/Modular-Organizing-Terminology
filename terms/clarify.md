#### Definitions

*To clarify* is *to make a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) more [efficiently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/efficient.md) [understandable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/understand.md)* for a *specific [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [participant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md)* in a [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

*Clarity* is a [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) which [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) how efficiently understandable a specific signal is for a specific type of participant in a social context. 

*Clear* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of signals which *have high clarity*.
		
#### Notes

*Clarity* can be considered a *[relational trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relational-trait.md)* which [depends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md) on the [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) between a specific [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) and a specific [user](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/user.md).  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a signal which is [effectively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md) clear for a [specialist](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialist.md) could be meaningless to many other participants.  However, when [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) for clarity, they sometimes design [generically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) for a "general audience", meaning all [competent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/competence.md) users of a specific [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md).
