#### Definitions

*To recommend* is *to [state](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md) that a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) or [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md)*, *or* its absence, would be [preferred](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/prefer.md) in a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

*A recommendation* is a statement that a specific action or activity would be preferred.

#### Notes

Recommendations often refer to others' [selections](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/select.md) from multiple [options](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/option.md); for example, selecting a specific [good](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/good.md) or [service](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/service.md).

Agents may create recommendations to *[support](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) [creative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) [production](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/produce.md)* or to *[govern](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md) [conceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) [risks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md)*.  

Recommendations of relationships between *[types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of elements* are often [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) as *[guidelines](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/guideline.md)*.  By contrast, recommendations of relationships between *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific) [instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of elements* are often identified as *recommendations*.   For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), recommendations of specific [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) for specific [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) can be [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) in *[collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md)*.
