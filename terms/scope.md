#### Definition

Scope is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) which [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) *[limits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md)* a *[possible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)* to a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) context*. 

Scope can be [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) by *[assigning](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) [parameters](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/parameter.md)* to *[variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).* 

#### Notes

Scope may be [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) as the the proportional [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) (or ratio) of the *magnitude of an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* to *the magnitude of a [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/context.md)* which it's considered within.  

Importantly, scope often indicates the relative size of an *[active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/active.md) context* to a *[potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/potential.md) context*.

Perceptions of scope often depend upon [ordinal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/order.md) rather than [interval](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) comparison, and can be neither mathematical nor precise.  Therefore, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/describe.md) scope vaguely and un[official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/official.md)ly as small, medium, large or massive.

Mathematically precise scope, when possible, is the *ratio* of an interval to its [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md), or to *another* specific interval *within* that dimension.

#### Example(s)

* An [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) might [request](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/request.md) to [discuss](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/discuss.md) the [topic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/topic.md) of *un[paid](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/remunerate.md) [work](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/work.md)* within the [scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md) of a specific [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md).
