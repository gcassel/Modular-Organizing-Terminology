#### Definition

A *kernel* is *the [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [foundational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)* of a [hierarchical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) system.

#### Notes

Kernels are especially associated with the *[operating systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/operating-system.md)* of [computers](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/computer.md).   A computing *kernel* [may](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/may.md) [suffice](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/suffice.md) to *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) an operating system*, but [designers](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) often [modify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modify.md) and [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) kernels to reflect the [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [requirements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) and [recommendations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommend.md) of [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) and [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) such as [software](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/software.md) companies.
