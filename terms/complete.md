#### Definition

*To complete* is *to [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) the [output](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md)* of a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md).

#### Notes

*Completion* is often [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md), [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) and [tasks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/task.md).  However, [determining](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/determine.md) completion requires *[perception](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) of process*, although that perception may be subconscious.
