#### Definition

*Immediate* is a *[relational trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relational-trait.md)* of [interaction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) in which *two or more [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md)* occur at *nearly the same [point](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/position.md) in [time](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/time.md)*.

#### Notes
		
*Immediacy* is not [strictly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) [possible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md), but it is nonetheless a [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) and [practical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/practice.md) [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) in *[describing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) or [designing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md)* potential *[sequences](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) of actions* which occur within relatively *small [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [locations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/locate.md)* (with respect to total extent of [spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md)) *and* either (1) occur [directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) or (2) are *rapidly mediated* by a *highly conductive medium*
		
In [planning](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md), the trait of immediacy may sometimes [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) as a useful [requirement](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md).
