#### Definition

An *operating system* is a *[system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) of [programs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/program.md)* which *[governs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) the [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) of a [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)*.

#### Specialized Definition

*Operating system* is [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [associated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/associate.md) with [computers](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/computer.md), although any *[complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) system* may have one.
		
A computer operating system often (but not necessarily) [enables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to [directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) [access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md), and to [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [modify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modify.md), many or most of a computer's functions.
