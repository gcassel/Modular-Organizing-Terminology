To automate is to *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) an [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md)* which does *not* [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) *[activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/activity.md) by any [person(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md)*.

**Notes:**  The [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/process.md) of *automation* often [transforms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/transform.md) existing activities into automatic activities.
