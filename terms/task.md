#### Definition

*A task* is *a [planned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md)* to *[support](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) or [project](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md).*

#### Notes

A task can be defined and documented in reasonably predictable ways which apparently do not require a new project or subproject.  (However, tasks can _turn into_ projects.)

[Official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) *[plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md)* often *[assign](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) [responsibility](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/responsibility.md) for tasks to be [performed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) by, or [delegated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/delegate.md) by, specific [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)*.

[Depending](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) on context, agents may potentially [complete](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complete.md) an assigned task by [directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) [performing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) the tasks, by [delegating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/delegate.md) them, or by otherwise satisfactorily [supporting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) the completion of the task.
