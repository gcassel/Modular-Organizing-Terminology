Conflict is *tension* or *pressure* which is [created](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) by  two or more [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) *in[compatible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compatible.md)* [motivations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/motivation.md), [intentions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md), [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) or [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  

For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), conflict often [develops](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) when one [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) has a specific goal, and another agent *intends to [prevent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/prevent.md)* the completion of that goal.   
 
**Notes:**  Conflict is a social [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) with highly [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) [states](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md).  

Conflict often leads to [contention](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/contend.md), [coercion](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coercion.md), [violence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/violence.md) and unintentional [damage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md).  Such actions may [motivate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/motivation.md) conflict *resolution* and *mediation* actions.
