#### Definition

*Custody* is a [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) in which an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) (1) currently *has [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [exclusive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/exclude.md) [access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md)* to a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) or (another) agent, and (2) therefore *is [socially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [responsible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/responsibility.md)* for *excluding [contextually](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) unacceptable [risky](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md) and [damaging](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md) [forces](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md)* from the resource or agent in custody.

#### Notes

Custody is *often* directly [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) to full access or [ownership](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/own.md) rights.  However, custody may be a *[required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md) [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md)* in some contexts *without* any [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [beneficial](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/benefit.md) [rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md) attached to it.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a delivery driver may need to take custody of three pizzas while driving to meet those pizzas' [buyer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/buy.md).  Likewise, a prison guard may need to take custody of a prisoner during required [transportation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transport.md).
