#### Definition

*An emergency* is a *[risky](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md) [status](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/status.md)* which *interrupts [planned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md)*.
	
#### Notes

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may expect a specific *[type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of emergency* to occasionally arise, and make [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) plans for how to deal with it.   Such plans may be *highly* generic, [intending](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) mainly to *minimize [damage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md)*.
