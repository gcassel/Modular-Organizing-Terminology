#### Definition

*To report* is *to [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) past [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md), [experiences](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) or [research](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/research.md) to another [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)*.

Reports are descriptions of past actions, experiences or research which agents [submit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/submit.md) to other agents.

#### Notes

Reports often describe *[complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) actions* by agents to *fulfill [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md)* and to *fulfill the [requirements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) of [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md)*.  
 
Reports may include simple [claims](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/claim.md).  However, complex reports are usually written as *[interpretive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interpret.md) [stories](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/story.md)* which (inconsistently) [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) available [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md), including [measurements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/measure.md) and [recordings](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/record.md).
