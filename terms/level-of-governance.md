#### Definition

*Levels of governance* are [hierarchies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) determined by *the [authority](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authority.md) to see or use a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) or [channel](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/channel.md)*.  They include technical primitives such as _read-write [access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md)_ to [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) resources.  

#### Notes

A level of authority is created whenever a [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) or [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [defines](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) [limitations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md) upon the [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) of one or more [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) which they govern, using various means such as passive and active [security](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/secure.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).
