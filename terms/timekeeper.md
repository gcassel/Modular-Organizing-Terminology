#### Definition

*Timekeeper* is the [role](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) of *helping to [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md) or [govern](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) an [event](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md)* by *[monitoring](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/monitor.md) and [reporting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/report.md) the passage of time*.

#### Note

The role of timekeeper can be [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) to be [directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) [subordinate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subordinate.md) to a facilitator role. It can also be defined independently, allowing [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to un[officially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [manage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/manage.md) [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) between facilitators and timekeepers.

Timekeepers are mainly [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) for [meetings](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/meet.md), although they can be useful for any events (including many games and sports) which [include](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) very time-sensitive relationships.
