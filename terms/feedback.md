Feedback is an *[output](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md) which becomes an [input](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md)* within a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)*.

**Notes:** 

*Positive feedback* increases the speed of a specific process, potentially at an [explosive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/explode.md) rate.  *Negative feedback* decreases the speed of a specific process.

Feedback [directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) *or* indirectly result from inputs.   (For example, positive feedback loops can result from outputs which go through several [filters](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/filter.md) before becoming inputs again, if the output still has a clearly [perceptible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) influence on the filtered feedback.)
