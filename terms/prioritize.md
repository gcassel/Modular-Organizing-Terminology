**Definitions:**

*To prioritize* is *to [rank](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rank.md) [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md)* according to their *[perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) [importance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) time-sensitive [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)*.

*Priority* is *perceived importance within a time-sensitive context*.
		
**Other [Forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md):**  

*A priority* is a goal which *ranks highly* (or *would* rank highly) in a prioritized list.
	
**Notes:**  

***Prioritize* usually implies a context which includes one or more *[sequential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md).***

*Effective* prioritization often [requires](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) the [identification](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) of an *extremely [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) context*.
