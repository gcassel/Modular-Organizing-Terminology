#### Definitions

*Frequency* is a [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) which [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) *how often a [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) occurs within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)*.

#### Notes

Frequency is often [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) or [calculated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/calculate.md) within the [limits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md) of specific [periods](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md). However, it can also [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) frequency *throughout the [predicted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) [duration](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/endure.md) of a specific potential action*.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) could predict that [accidents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accident.md) of a specific [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) will occur rarely or never during a specific period of heightened vigilance, but that such actions will occur at Frequency X over the entire duration of Activity 1.
