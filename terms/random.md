#### Definitions

*Random* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of *un[intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*, and may have two [special](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [meanings](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mean.md):
* as a trait of an element which has entered a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) *without being [selected](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/select.md)*, and has no specific [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) *cause(s)*.
* as a trait of *unintentional] [order](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/order.md)* which *has not been [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md)*, and has no specific perceived causes.
		
#### Notes

* [Arbitrary](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/arbitrary.md) is a closely [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) term which is arguably more precise and flexibly [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md).
* Randomized elements will [tend](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tend.md) to be widely [distributed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) or dispersed according to specific criteria.  However, this depends on the *size of a [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md)* of randomized elements, and will [vary](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) in specific *[instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of randomization*.
* Whether or not randomness [truly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/true.md) exists is outside of the intended [scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md) of [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/).
