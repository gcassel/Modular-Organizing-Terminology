#### Definitions

*To agree* is *to [recognize](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recognize.md) the [validity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/valid.md) of a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md)* within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

*Agreement* is a *[relational trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relational-trait.md)* which [indicates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) that *two or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [agree](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agree.md) on a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md)*.

#### Specialized Definition

*An [official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) agreement* is *a [statement](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md) which is [mutually](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mutual.md) [approved](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/approve.md)* by *all [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  

#### Notes 

To fully agree with a concept, we must agree with the validity of each [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) within that concept.  This is often quite [socially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) challenging.  (It's hard to fully agree with highly complex concepts.)

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) agreements through [discussion](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dialogue.md) and [proposals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/propose.md).  Proposals and agreements may be developed through any combination of [sequential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) and [parallel](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/parallel.md) [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md).

**Official agreements are [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) in many [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) contexts.**  Official agreements are *[authorized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authorize.md) by [governing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) agents* in many contexts. 

Official agreements must be clearly and demonstrably [approved](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/approve.md), often via the [signatures](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signature.md) of agreeing agents in [persistently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md) [stored](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [items](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/item.md).

Agreements must be stated in a *[mutually](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mutual.md) [understood](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/understand.md) [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md)*.

**Agreements often [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) [plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md)**, although a *[shared](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/common.md) plan* is just one basic *[type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of agreement*.
