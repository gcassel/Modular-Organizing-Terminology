*To agree* is *to [perceive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) [truth](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/true.md) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md)* within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Notes:** To truly agree with a concept, we must agree with the [validity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/valid.md) of each [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) in that concept and context.  This is often quite [socially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md).
