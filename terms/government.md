#### Definition

A *government* is a [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) which [establishes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/establish.md) and [enforces](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md) [rules](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rule.md) which apply to an entire geographic [region](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/region.md).

#### Notes

While each government has [jurisdiction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/jurisdiction.md) within an entire region, governments are often [hierarchically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) [formed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) to apply not only to large [autonomous](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/autonomy.md) nation-states, but to divisions and subdivisions within them such as counties, cities and other municipalities.
