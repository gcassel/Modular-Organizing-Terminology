#### Definition

*To telecommunicate* is *to [communicate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communicate.md) in[directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) by [transmitting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md) one or more electronic [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md)* via a *signalling [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md)*.  

#### Notes

*Telecommunication* [tends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tend.md) to be associated with the transmission of signals which [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) *visual and/or audio* [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md).  However, *[digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) networking* (including the World Wide Web) is telecommunicative.

Telecommunication *[enables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) [live communications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/live-communication.md) at extended [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) distances*, outside of the *range* of human *sensory organs*.  However, people can (and increasingly do) telecommunicate within the range of potential direct physical signaling.  (For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a parent might [send](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/send.md) a [text](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/text.md) phone [message](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/message.md) to a child in the same house.)
