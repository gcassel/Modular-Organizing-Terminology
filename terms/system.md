#### Definition

*A system* is a *[network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) which [performs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)* within specific [conditions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/condition.md).  (In other words, a system is a web of [connections](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/connect.md) which turns [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) into [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md).)

#### Notes

***System* is an extremely [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) which applies to many or most [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md), including all [organisms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organism.md), [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) and machines**( as well as many other [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md).

Systems can be *[physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md), [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) or [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md)*.  Systems can [emerge](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) or be [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) by [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md). 

Systems are [created](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) by [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) which [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md) and [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md), [creating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) *positive* or *negative [feedback](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/feedback.md)*, which *amplifies* or *attenuates* subsequent inputs.   

[Robust](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/robust.md) systems have well-defined positive and negative feedback systems which create [sustainability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) and [security](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/secure.md) against [predictable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) and likely [risks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md). [Resilient](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resilient.md) systems are robust *and* are *[complexly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [adaptive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/adaptive.md)* to diverse inputs.

Some systems may be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) mainly by networks of [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md).  For instance, a toaster is a system which has been created by networking physical components which match [modular](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/module.md) [specifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) for systemic [function(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).
