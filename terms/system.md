*A system* is a *[network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md)* which *[support](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)*.  

**Notes:**  

*System* is an extremely [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) which applies to many or most [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) including *organisms* and many [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md).

Systems may be *[physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md), [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) or [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md)*, and may [emerge](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) or be [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) by [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md). 

Systems are generally determined by [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) of [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md) and [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) which [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) *positive* or *negative [feedback](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/feedback.md)* which can *amplify* or *attenuate* inputs.   

*Robust* systems have well-defined positive and negative feedback systems which create [sustainability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) and [security](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/secure.md) against potential [damage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md).  *Resilient* systems are robust *and* are *[complexly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [adaptive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/adaptive.md)* to diverse inputs.

Some systems may be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) mainly by networks of [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).  For instance, a toaster is a system which has been created by networking physical [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) which match [specifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) for systemic [function(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).
