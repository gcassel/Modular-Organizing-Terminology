#### Definition

*A database* is a *[governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [items](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/item.md) which have been [semantically linked](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/semantic-link.md) to each other according to a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [format](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/format.md)*.  
		
#### Notes

*Database* is distinguished here as a governed network to distinguish it from [linked data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/linked-data.md), which is a more expansive [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md).

*Database* is an extremely [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md).  However, specific database formats may have *[strictly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) [detailed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/detail.md) [specifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md)*.
