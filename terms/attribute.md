**Definition:**  An attribute is a  *[descriptive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) label* which *[represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/representation.md) a supposed [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md)*.   

**Notes:**  Attributes are *[relational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*.   *Attribute* is a very generic [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md).   Attributes are inherently different than [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md), but the terms are *not* mutually exclusive.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), if an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [accurately](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) [identifies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) and [assigns](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) a property, then that element is both an attribute *and* a property.
	
**Examples:** 
* Agent A gives Product X a 5 star *rating*.  That [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) rating is an attribute.
* Community A gives Product X a total of 183 ratings with an arithmetic mean (average) of 3.8.  That average rating is an attribute.
* Photographer A submits *Image* X to a photography forum, and [assigns] the descriptive tag of "sunset" to that image.  "Sunset" is an attribute.
