#### Definition

*An attribute* is a *[perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) which an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) has [assigned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) to an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* (often an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) or [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

Attributes are *[relational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) elements*.      Attributes are [fundamentally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) different than [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md), but those terms are *not* [mutually exclusive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mutually-exclusive.md).  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), if an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [accurately](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) [identifies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) and assigns a property, then that element is both an attribute *and* a property.
	
#### Examples

* Agent A gives Product X a 5 star *rating*.  That [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) rating is an attribute.
* Community A gives Product X a total of 183 ratings with an arithmetic mean (average) of 3.8.  That average rating is an attribute.
* Photographer A submits *Image* X to a photography forum, and [assigns] the descriptive tag of "sunset" to that image.  "Sunset" is an attribute.
