*To punish* is *to [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [damage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md)* one or more agents because of [belief(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/believe.md) about their *past actions*.

#### Notes

Punishment is sometimes *rationalized* according to [concepts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) such as *retribution* and/or *deterrence*.
 
Punishment differs deeply from concepts such as *remediation* and *restorative justice*.
