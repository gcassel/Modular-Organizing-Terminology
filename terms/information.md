#### Definition

*Information* consists of *[related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) and [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)* which *are [actively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) present and discretely [identifiable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md)* within one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

8/16/19: *Information* is being deprioritized in MOT in favor of the more specialized term *[data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md)*, which in this author's opinion avoids the philosophical problems involved in usefully defining (and limiting) *information*.  Therefore, *information* will probably be delinked from many or most uses.

2017: My much longer description of "information" elsewhere is gradually being updated, and may or may not be added here.  I find it difficult to create a [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) definition which *accurately and sufficiently [describes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md), [mental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mental.md) and [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) information.*   For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), physical information is active within physical contexts and mental information is active within [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) contexts, *but* social contexts are physically *mediated* (often via [signs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sign.md) carried by [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md)).   I'll keep working on the variables.
