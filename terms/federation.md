A federation is a *[group agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md)* which *contains group agents*.
 
The [description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) above is [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) simple.  However, “federation” has been applied to many [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) groups with diverse [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md). 
 
Strictly speaking, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a federation by [developing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) a [coordinating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordinate.md) group agent which [governs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md) [specifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) for the [membership](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/member.md) of group agents in the federation.  

In some cases, a federation's coordinating agent may specify that member group agents-- and *their* members-- are *subordinate* to the coordinating agent in one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md), [responsibilities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/responsibility.md) and/or [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md).  In other cases, member group agents and/or member [personal agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/personal-agent.md) may be considered mostly or completely [autonomous](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/autonomy.md).
