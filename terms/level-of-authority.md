#### Definition

*Levels of authority* are [hierarchies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) determined by the [authority](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authority.md) to see or use [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md); they include technical primitives such as _read-write [access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md)_ to [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) resources.  

#### Notes

Levels of authority include levels of [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) and [control](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/control.md), which are probably what most people think of as hierarchy.  A level of authority is created any time that a system or agent creates definitive limitations upon the use of one or more resources which they govern, using various means such as passive and active [security](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/secure.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).
