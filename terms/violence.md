#### Definition

Violence is [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) which *[creates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) [significant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) [harm](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/harm.md), or [clear](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/clear.md) [risk](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md) of significant harm*, either (1) *[intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md)* or (2) due to *grossly [neglecting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/neglect.md) [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) [risks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md)*.

#### Notes

As of 25 July 2024, this definition has reverted to an iterative work-in-progress, trying to evolve the subtlety and flexible relevance of such an important term.

In [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), it's subtly important to distinguish *violence* from intentional avoidance or enervation, such as boycotts and (some) sanctions.  For example, there's a profoundly important difference between refusing to engage in transactions (boycotting) or refusing to [collaborate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaborate.md) with a person or [project](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md) and, in contrast, actively seeking to harm them.

#### Related Terms
*[Fraud](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fraud.md)* is a direct subtype of violence.
