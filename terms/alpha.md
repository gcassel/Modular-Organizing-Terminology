#### Definition

An *alpha* is a *[prototype](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/prototype.md)* which *isn’t ready for [direct](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) within its [naming](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/name.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)*.

#### Notes

If a prototype is an alpha for *[Collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) A*, then it’s not ready for [responsible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/responsibility.md) use by many or most people in Collective A.

Prototype names may use “-alpha” or, in a reasonably clear context, simply “a”.
