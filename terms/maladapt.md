#### Definition

*To maladapt* is *to [change](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/change.md) an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) in a way which decreases its [fitness](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fitness.md)* in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md). 
		
#### Notes

The *[act](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) of maladaptation* can be considered [harmful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/harm.md) in a [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) context, even if a maladapted element remains mostly [beneficial](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/benefit.md) within that context.
		
A *[type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of element* may become maladapted for a specific context because it's become *better adapted* for a *different* context.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a *species of organism* may adapt for a specific *[physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [ecosystem](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ecosystem.md)* in ways which are maladaptive in another ecosystem which *some specimens* of that species live in.  Also, a species or [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may adapt for a *[temporary](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/temporary.md) [status](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/status.md)* (such as an [emergency](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergency.md)) in ways which are maladaptive during a *longer [period](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md)* within a specific context.
