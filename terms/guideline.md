#### Notes

Guidelines can be [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) or [shared](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/share.md).  Shared guidelines can [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) for a [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) *or* for any [teams](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/team.md) which a collective *[delegates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/delegate.md) [authority](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authority.md)* to. 

Guidelines are sometimes [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) in [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [communities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md) and collectives.

*Guidelines* are often [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) along with *[rules](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rule.md)*, just as *recommendations* are often used along with *[requirements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md)*.
