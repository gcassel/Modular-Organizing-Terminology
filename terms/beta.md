#### Definition

A *beta* is a *[prototype](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/prototype.md)* which *is [experimentally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experiment.md) [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md)* within its [naming](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/name.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

The naming context (and intended users) of a beta is often either (1) the general public or (2) an invited group.  

Beta users are asked to provide critical developmental feedback.

Prospective beta users may or may not be expected to use the beta resource.

Beta filenames may use “-beta” or, in a reasonably clear context, simply “b”.
