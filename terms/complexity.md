#### Definitions

*Complexity* is a [compound](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compound.md) [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) which [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) *variety*, *frequency* and *amplitude* of *[grouping](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) and/or [interaction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md)* within a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).

*Complex* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of forms which have *high complexity* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

Complexity can create [predictable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) *or* unpredictable [conditions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/status.md).

Complexity can be [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) as an un[limit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md)ed positive dimension with the [parameters](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/parameter.md) of zero (for complete chaos) and *infinity*.

Complexity via variety can arise through a relatively small number of complex relationships; i.e., only two elements [interact](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md), but they interact quite differently depending on each element's current [status](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/status.md) and/or the [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) in which the interaction occurs.

Complexity can rarely be [measured](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/measure.md) effectively except in relatively *less-complex* (and artificial) *[design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)*.
