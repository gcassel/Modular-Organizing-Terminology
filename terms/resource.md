#### Definition

A *resource* is *any non-[agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [force](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md) or [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)* which *can [support](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) one or more [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

This [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [definition](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) includes all *[physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md), [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md), [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) and [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md)* resources.  Resources are often important [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) in [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).

Agents often [perceive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md), [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) and [discuss](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dialogue.md) *[types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) and [instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md)* of resource.  

[Access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md) to resources is often determined by their relationships to other resources, agents and systems, including [policies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/policy.md) when relevant.
