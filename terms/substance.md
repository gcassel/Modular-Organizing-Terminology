#### Definition

A substance is a [force](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md) which is *very [predictable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) and [stable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/stabilize.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

Substances are often perceived as "material", "objects" or "things".  However, they can be directly [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) with (often [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md)) forces.

Substances are always [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md), but like most elements, they can often be identified more [accurately](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) as [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).
