#### Definitions

*To compound* is to *[group](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) separately [identifiable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* to *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) an [emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)*. 

*A compound* is *a group of separately identifiable elements which creates an emergent functional form.*

*A composite* is a compound which consists of relatively large and separately identifiable [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md).

#### Notes

The distinction between compound and composite is rarely of formal value (because it's a slippery slope).

While most if not all [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) could [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) be [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) as compounds, the term *compound* [refers](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/refer.md) to forms in which all [root](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/root.md) structural [factors](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/factor.md) seem to have been identified.  Example:  We call water a compound, because the molecule seems to be entirely created by the chemical bond between one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms.  By contrast, we don't normally think of an oil painting as a compound, because it may include many subtle [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) and formal elements which are hard to comprehensively identify and relate to each other.
