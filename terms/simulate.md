#### Definition

*To simulate* is *to [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) an [experiment](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experiment.md) on a [model](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) of a [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)*.

#### Notes

*Simulations* often are performed via [computations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compute.md) based on [dimensional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) which have been assigned to models or their components.  However, they can also be performed by [imagining](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/imagine.md).
