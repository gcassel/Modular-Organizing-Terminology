#### Definition

FYI (or "for your information") is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of any [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) which *[invites](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/invite.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to [receive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/receive.md) (and, if they [desire](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) to, [analyze](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/analyze.md) and [evaluate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/evaluate.md)) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)*. 

#### Notes

FYI can be used as a noun as well as an adjective.

An FYI doesn't necessarily make any [request(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/request.md) of agents who receive the signal.  However, it will typically support one or more [channels](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/channel.md) for [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [feedback](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/feedback.md) from its [recipients](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/receive.md).
