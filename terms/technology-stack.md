#### Definition

A *technology stack* is *a [hierarchy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) of [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md) and/or [techniques](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technique.md) which is [required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) by a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [level of design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level-of-design.md)*.

#### Notes

A technology stack can include any number of tools & techniques which build from a foundation to whatever level of complexity is required or desired.  While this term developed in information technology, it's generally useful for modeling complexly [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) systems.
