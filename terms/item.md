#### Definition

An item is a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [instance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md)* of a *[uniquely](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) and [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [replicable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/replicate.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)*.

#### Notes

[Media items](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media-item.md) are [inherently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) replicable, which is why we can accurately refer to them *as items* instead of as [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) or [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).
