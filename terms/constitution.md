#### Definition

A *constitution* is *the [root](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/root.md) [governing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) [agreement](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agree.md) of a [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md)*.

#### Notes

Constitutional [documents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/document.md) are often [developed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) separately instead of [creating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a single constitution.  Separated and [sequential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequential.md) development can often be more [inclusive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) and [efficient](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/efficient.md).

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [may](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/may.md) [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) constitutions to [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) other agreements.

A constitution must *[identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) and [define](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) the collective* by [name](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/name.md) and [mission](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mission.md).  The constitution should include at least enough [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) [policy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/policy.md) to [protect](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/protect) the collective identity against [predictable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) [risks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md).
