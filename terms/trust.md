#### Definition

*Trust* is the [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) of *[confidence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/confidence.md) in an [agent's](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [probability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/probability.md) of [performing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) a [desired](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) or [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

The term *trust* is often used [vaguely](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/vague.md) to [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) [general](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) confidence in specific agents, although that general confidence would probably increase or decrease for specific actions and activities.  (For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), I might generally trust Person A, but not trust them to remember their keys when they leave the house; or I might not trust them to keep a specific secret, etcetera.)
