#### Definition

An instance is a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* within a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)*.

#### Notes

*Instance* is an extremely [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) which may, for [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) any *[active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) [value](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/value.md)* for any [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md).

Instances of elements may or may *not* match the [descriptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) (or, when applicable, [specifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md)) of one or more [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md).

* [unit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unit.md):  Instances are often units, and units are often instances.  However, the [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) of *instance* isn't [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to the *[definition](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/definition.md) of types* (which creates *units*).
