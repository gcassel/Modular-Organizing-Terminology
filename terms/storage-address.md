#### Definition

*A storage address* is *an [address](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/address.md) which [identifies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) a [storage-](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md)[location](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/location.md).*
		
Storage addresses *[enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* to *[persistently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persistent.md) store, [organize](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organize.md), sort, filter and search for* [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) contained within [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md).  
		
#### Notes

Storage addresses are [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) by *one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)*.   In fact it's quite common for the governance of storage addresses to be ([officially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) *or* unofficially) shared between two or more agents who do not *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md),* nor otherwise create any *[decision](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decide.md) [rule(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rule.md)* regarding the *[modification](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modify.md) of [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md)* within the storage address.   Such in[formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) approaches can often be [sustainable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) *in the absence of persistent [conflict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/conflict.md)* between the governing agents.
		
*Specific [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [items](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/item.md)* are often closely [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to specific storage addresses.  However, close relationships are not inevitable.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), [Inclusive Framework](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1-WFMRYdueSBba1atcohX0G585zj-gBNlBvZQBqnEmEs/edit?usp=sharing) [recommends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommend.md) a *distributed hosting [model](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md)* which could [liberate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/independent.md) [shared](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/common.md) media items from dependence on any specific storage addresses.
